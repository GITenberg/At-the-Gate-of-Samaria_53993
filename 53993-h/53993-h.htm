    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a severe
      room, scrupulously neat. Along one side ran a bookcase, with beaded glass
      doors, containing, as one might see by peering through the spaces, the
      collected, unread literature of two stern generations. A few old prints,
      placed in bad lights, hung on the walls. In the centre of the room was a
      leather-covered library table, with writing materials arranged in painful
      precision. A couch was lined along one wall, in the draught of the door.
      On either side of the fireplace were ranged two stiff leather armchairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of these chairs sat an old man, in the other a faded woman just
      verging upon middle age. The old man was looking at a picture which he
      supported on his knees-a narrow, oblong strip of canvas nailed on to a
      rough wooden frame. The woman eyed him with some interest, as if awaiting
      a decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were father and daughter, and bore a strange family resemblance to
      each other. Both faces were pale, their foreheads high and narrow, marked
      by faint horizontal lines, their eyes gray and cold, their upper lips long
      and thin, setting tightly, without mobility, upon the lower. The only
      essential point of difference was that the father's chin was weakly
      pointed, the daughter's squarer and harder. Both faces gave one the
      impression of negativeness, joylessness, seeming to lack the power of
      strong emotive expression. One can see such, minus the refinement of
      gentle birth and social amenities, in the pews of obscure dissenting
      chapels, testifying that they have been led thither not by strong
      convictions, but by the force of mild circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as is the case with hundreds of our upper middle-class families,
      the Davenants had descended from a fierce old Puritan stock, and though
      the reality of their Puritanism had gradually lost itself in the current
      of more respectable orthodoxy, its shadow hung over them still. The
      vigorous enthusiasm that spurred the Puritan on to lofty action was gone;
      the vague dread of sin that kept him in moral and mental inactivity alone
      remained. Perhaps it is this survival amongst us of the negative element
      of Puritanism that produces in England the curious anomaly of education
      without enlightenment. It has dulled our perception of life as an art,
      whose &ldquo;great incidents,&rdquo; as Fielding finely says, &ldquo;are no more to be
      considered as mere accidents than the several members of a fine statue or
      a noble poem.&rdquo; It has caused us to live in a perpetual twilight in which
      the possibilities of existence loom fantastic and indistinct. The
      Davenants were gentlefolk, holding a good position in the small country
      town of Durdleham; they visited among the county families, and, on
      ordinary, conventional grounds, considered themselves to belong to the
      cultured classes. They were the curious yet familiar product of the
      old-fashioned, high-church Toryism impregnated with the Puritan taint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was fading through the French window behind the old man's chair.
      He laid down the canvas on his lap and looked in a puzzled way at the
      fire. Then he raised it nearer to his eyes for further examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is really very dreadful,&rdquo; he said at last, looking at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something will have to be done soon,&rdquo; replied the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so horribly vulgar, Grace,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;look at that boy's
      nose&mdash;and that drunken man&mdash;his face is a nightmare of evil. I
      really must begin to talk seriously to Clytie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blather smiled somewhat pityingly. Since the earliest days of her
      long widowhood she had undertaken the charge of her father's house and the
      care of her two younger sisters, Janet and Clytie. Her familiarity,
      therefore, with the seamy side of Clytie's nature had been of long
      duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well talk to that fender, papa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Clytie has got
      it into her head that she is going to be an artist, and no amount of
      talking will get it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all through her visiting those friends of hers, the Farquharsons.
      They are not nice people for her to know. I shall not let her go there
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she goes on like this there is no knowing what will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did the child get these repulsive and ungirlish notions from?&rdquo; the
      old man asked querulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conception of the picture was not that of a young girl, and though the
      execution was crude and untrained, there was a bold cruelty of touch that
      saved it from being amateurish. The canvas was divided into two panels. On
      the one was painted a tiny bully of a boy with his arm rounded across his
      throat, about to strike a weakly, poverty-stricken little girl. They were
      children of the poorest classes, the boy realistically, offensively dirty&mdash;the
      <i>petit morveux</i> in its absolute sense. Behind them was the open
      doorway of a red-brick, jerry-built cottage, showing a strip of torn and
      dirty matting along the passage that lost itself in the gloom beyond. On
      the other panel was the corner of a public house in a low slum, the window
      lights and a gas-lamp throwing a lurid glare upon wet pavement and the
      figures of a woman and a drunken man. The faces were those of the children
      in the first picture, and the eternal tragedy was repeating itself. The
      man's face was loathsome in its sodden ferocity; the woman, with a child
      in her arms, was reeling from the blow. The evident haste in which the
      panels had been painted, the glaring, unsoftened colouring, heightened as
      if by impressionist design the coarse realism of the effect. Above was
      written the legend, &ldquo;<i>La joie de vivre</i>&rdquo; and in the left-hand bottom
      corner, &ldquo;<i>Clytie Davenant pinxit</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has certainly grown much worse of late,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Blather, holding
      out her thin, short hand to shield her face from the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause of some moments. Mr. Davenant ceased nursing the picture
      and stood it on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you quite made up your mind, papa,&rdquo; said Mrs.
    Blather at length, &ldquo;not to let Clytie go to the Slade School in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is out of the question,&rdquo; replied the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so, papa. It would perhaps do her good. A year or so's hard
      work would take all these silly ideas out of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I question it,&rdquo; said Mr. Davenant. &ldquo;They are not silly ideas. They are
      debased, degraded ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear papa, they are only fads. All young girls have them. Look how
      crazy Janet was to join the cookery classes. We let her join, and now she
      hates the sight of a pie-dish. With Clytie it is quite the same, only she
      wants to daub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her daub in a decent way at home,&rdquo; replied the old man testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blather shrugged her lean shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have tried that and it hasn't succeeded, apparently,&rdquo; she said drily.
      &ldquo;You seldom come in her way; you don't know how unpleasant things are for
      Janet and myself. What do you think she had the impertinence to tell me
      this morning? She said that we were not real people. We were machines or
      abstractions based, I think she said, on a formula, or something of that
      sort. She was pining to live amongst living human beings. And then she is
      so rude to visitors. What do you think she said to the vicar, who came, at
      Janet's request, to talk to her about her shameful neglect of her
      religious duties? She said, if he was a pillar of the Church, she saw no
      reason why she should be a seat-cushion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, tut,&rdquo; said the old man angrily. He was vicar's churchwarden, and a
      power in the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Blather, &ldquo;when I scolded her for her rudeness,
      she said that if she had been a man she would have sworn at him for his
      impertinence. Really people will soon be afraid of coming to the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Davenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a wise woman, Mrs. Blather did not press her point. She knew she had
      thoroughly alarmed her father and had shown him but one way out of the
      difficulty. His taking it, if left to himself, was only a question of
      time. She rang the bell for the servant to come and light Mr. Davenant's
      gas, and then she left him to his reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Davenant possessed some landed property, which he had occupied his
      life in mismanaging. Fortunately for him, his wife had brought him a small
      fortune which sufficed to keep up a position, modest when compared with
      that of the Davenants of former days, but still high enough to satisfy the
      social aspirations of his family. He had lived a colourless life, severe
      and respectable. Even his university days had passed in a dull uniformity,
      leaving no glamour behind them. He had walked honourably and blindly in
      the paths his parents had indicated, and, now that he was nearing the end
      of the journey, thanked God for having given him the grace not to err from
      them. He had married when still fairly young, and he had loved his wife in
      a gentlemanly, passionless way. She, poor thing, had filled up so small a
      space in life that she had faded out of it almost unnoticed&mdash;even by
      himself. He had no storms of joy or sorrow to look back upon. His
      thoughts, as he brooded over the fireside, generally wandered back to
      trifling incidents: ancient municipal interests, the mortgages on his
      estate, the boundary quarrels with the old earl, his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But lately he had been thinking anxiously over his daughter Clytie. She
      had suddenly developed out of a naughty, rebellious child into a problem.
      He assumed as a matter of course that he bore her the ordinary
      well-regulated parental affection, but in his heart of hearts he never
      really loved her. Until lately it had not occurred to him to think of her
      as anything but a child of his with a singularly unfortunate disposition
      which time would modify. But time, on the contrary, was accentuating it,
      and he realised at last that Clytie had a distinct individuality. His
      philosophy had left many things in heaven and earth undreamed of. He was
      mystified, puzzled. How could he and his delicate wife have brought this
      bright-haired, full-blooded, impulsive creature into existence? Her
      sisters were gentle, quiet women, possessing the virtues inculcated in his
      conception of life. Clytie seemed to possess none of them. The peasant
      woman in the legend could not have wondered more over her changeling. How
      could a daughter of his and a sister of Janet's scoff at sacred things,
      defy social rules, and have an imagination that ran riot in scenes of
      drunkenness and outcast life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Physiology might grant a solution to the old man's problem in the law of
      the alternation of heredity. His father's youngest brother had been a
      family black sheep, and being the only one of the generation who had led
      an eventful career, was naturally never mentioned by his relations, and
      the record of his life perished with him. But it is possible that the
      positive enthusiastic principle of Clytie's Puritan descent, reasserting
      itself once in every other generation, to the horror of the negative
      principle that otherwise ran through the race continuously, came out in
      her with all its strength and vigour. It brought her eager, panting up to
      the brink of our surging nineteenth century life, imperiously bidding her
      plunge in and take her part in the tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now nineteen, an age when girls try to realise themselves. She
      discovered that she was a greater problem to herself than to her sisters.
      They simply looked upon her as odd, eccentric, unpleasant to live with,
      and if she had not been their sister would have almost gathered up their
      skirts around them as they passed her by. But she was conscious of a
      craving within her that did not proceed from mere wilful caprice. In her
      earlier girlhood she had thought long and humbly over her shortcomings.
      Why could she not be as contented and dutiful as Janet? Why could not the
      interests that satisfied her sisters' life satisfy hers? Often and often
      an impulse of scorn and ridicule at the littleness of Durdleham would
      overmaster her, and then would follow a passionate fit of remorse and
      repentance, received with coldness and ruffled dignity on her sisters'
      part, that would send her back humiliated and rebellious to her room. From
      what springs of desire did all this proceed? Whither were these impulses
      tending?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since she could hold a pencil she had been able to draw. She had
      received lessons in painting later on, and had covered canvas after canvas
      with the graceful futilities the Durdleham art teacher suggested. He was a
      landscape painter, and Clytie had little or no feeling for landscape.
      Bright colour, vivid contrast, sharp tone, attracted her, but the quiet
      grays and faint blues of our English scenery came out dull and mechanical
      when she tried to paint them. At last she gave up her lessons in despair,
      much to the wonderment of Janet, who improved greatly under instruction,
      and turned out neat, complacent little water-colours which she sold at
      bazaars or distributed among her friends. For months Clytie never touched
      a brush. Art of this sort revolted her. It was soulless, futile. But by
      degrees, as the breach between herself and her sisters widened, her power
      of painting became a source of ineffable consolation&mdash;a means of
      self-commune. She could give external expression to the voices that
      haunted her. She read books with the eagerness only exhibited by the young
      girl craving for self-development; and the pictures they vividly impressed
      on her young imaginative brain she transferred to paper or canvas&mdash;not
      lovingly, tenderly, with the pure artistic delight of gradual creation,
      but hurriedly, feverishly, longing to see the thing done, the impression
      realised in a way in which she could understand it. When finished, or
      rather as soon as it had reached an impressionist stage of artistic
      completeness, she would feast her heart upon it for a day or two, and then
      throw it away, or let it lie about in a corner disregarded and forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until she was nearly eighteen Mrs. Blather had scrupulously supervised her
      reading, and Clytie, chafing with irritation, had been compelled either to
      submit or to smuggle condemned books into the house and read them
      surreptitiously. But at last her angry impatience at the impeccable
      literature that satisfied her sisters' needs burst its restraints, and
      resisted vehemently and finally all censorship on the part of Mrs.
      Blather.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not wholesome, this solitary, emotional, imaginative life. Her
      health showed signs of giving way. They called in a doctor, who prescribed
      rest and a change of air. One of her aunts, who lived in London, happened
      to want a companion for a tour on the Continent, and with many misgivings
      undertook to take Clytie with her. To the girl the trip was an endless
      succession of delight. Impressions followed each other too fast for her to
      realise them. The superficial features of continental life, familiar and
      commonplace enough to the ordinary traveller, were new to her. Groups at
      street corners, strangely attired soldiers, odd un-English-looking shops,
      the very waiters hurrying along through the intricacies of café tables
      with their fantastically laden trays, all excited her, filled her with the
      exhilaration of life and movement. Her aunt, who had hitherto shared the
      family opinion of Clytie, wondered greatly at the transformation. It never
      occurred to her that this was the natural Clytie filling her heart at last
      with the emotions it had hungered for.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during this time, at a pension in Dresden, that she formed the
      acquaintance of the Farquharsons. Miss Davenant discovered that they and
      herself had common acquaintances in London, and that she had heard of Mr.
      Farquharson as an archæologist of some repute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The acquaintance thus formed developed quickly into a pleasant intimacy of
      travel. Mrs. Farquharson, a bright, clever woman of forty, was attracted
      toward Clytie, who, for her part, found in her new friend a natural
      sympathy that touched her heart. So far did their sudden friendship go,
      that before they parted Clytie had conditionally accepted an invitation to
      visit the archæologist and his wife in Harley Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Davenant's permission was asked he at first demurred. He had the
      country-bred man's distrust of strangers; but when his sister vouched for
      the social position of the Farquharsons he reluctantly consented. Clytie
      paid her promised visit the following winter. This was one of the turning
      points of her life. For the first time she found herself in an
      intellectual, artistic society. It was a glimpse of another world. At
      Durdleham young men seldom came to the house. When they did, they avoided
      her and talked platitudes to her sisters. At dinner parties the men
      remained in the dining-room long after the ladies had left. They seemed to
      regard them as somewhat picturesque but wearisome household adjuncts,
      whose absence their masculine intellects unreservedly welcomed;
      conversation with their partner was a dinner incident to be got through,
      like shaving or putting on their white ties beforehand. And the Durdleham
      ladies seemed to take this as a matter of course, and were equally happy
      to get by themselves and gossip mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in Harley Street Clytie found a different order of things. Men and
      women seemed to have interests in common and to discuss them on a basis of
      perfect equality. She found, too, women speaking authoritatively on
      certain subjects and listened to with deference by men. All, young and
      old, talked to her as if she were as much absorbed in life as themselves.
      No one made her rage with humiliation by tolerating her with an air of
      languid or pompous condescension. Even the frivolities and platitudes of
      everyday conversation were treated in a way new to her experience. The
      talk was keen, incisive, exaggerated. Everyone could say what he wished
      without fear of springing some mine of prejudice or prudery. The
      atmosphere of the house breathed freedom of thought and action. She beheld
      others putting into form her own vague aspirations. She saw people who
      wrote, painted, acted, living fully and intensely every day. Even the
      professed idlers whom she met seemed to hold their fingers on the throb of
      life around them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the streets&mdash;she had been but little in London before&mdash;she
      saw things strange and fascinating&mdash;things she had read about,
      dreamed of, painted, and yet not understood. She was appalled by her
      ignorance, the narrow gauge of her sympathies. What did all this restless
      life in the great city mean, its wild cries and passions that struck upon
      her tightly strung nerves with a deep, mysterious resonance?
    </p>
    <p>
      She filled a sketch-book with the vivid impressions each day brought her,
      seeking, as her way was, to realise them by tearing them out of herself,
      and giving them objectivity. A royal academician picked up the book from
      the corner of a table in the drawing-room, where Clytie, falling easily
      into the careless ways of the household, had thrown it. He was turning
      over the pages when Clytie perceived him, and rushed impulsively to him
      across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you mustn't look at that, Mr. Redgrave. Please don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? It is rather interesting. Why don't you learn to draw?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would be the good?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This suits my purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other shrugged his shoulders good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That all depends upon what your purpose is,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If you want to
      become an artist you must train properly for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Become an artist! The words haunted her all that night. They opened up
      before her infinite vistas of possibilities, life in the midst of the
      world, the knowledge of its greatnesses and its mysteries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning she wrote to him. He invited her to come to his studio and
      talk over the matter. She asked Mrs. Farquharson to accompany her, but her
      hostess was engaged at the hour in question. Clytie looked disappointed.
      The home traditions asserted themselves and prevented her from thinking it
      possible to go unchaperoned. Mrs. Farquharson divined this and laughed in
      her bright way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness gracious, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the man isn't going to eat you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Clytie went alone to the studio to learn her destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have great talent,&rdquo; said the artist, &ldquo;but it needs cultivation. After
      two or three years' severe training you may do something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Clytie asked him the question that had been burning her heart for two
      days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I shall ever be able to earn my own living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might do that now, if you chose, and had patience,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By book illustrating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I want to become a great artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless. Most of us do. You may if you try hard, and love art for art's
      sake. But,&rdquo; he added, looking at her keenly&mdash;&ldquo;there always is a
      'but,' Miss Davenant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Parce que</i>, as the French say&mdash;begging your pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was practically the end of the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had happened to Clytie three months before Mrs. Blather had
      discovered the offending picture in Clytie's attic studio and had carried
      it to her father. After this foretaste of life the girl wearied more than
      ever of Durdleham with its soullessness, its stagnation, its prim
      formulas. A dangerous reaction of spirit set in, leading her to long
      spells of hopeless melancholy, alternating with outbursts of passionate
      rebellion. She would stand for hours in the recess of her window gazing
      over the flat stretch of country, and dreaming strange dreams of the world
      that lay beyond the dreary horizon&mdash;dreams in which sharp
      reminiscence mingled with fancy in vague, weird shapes. But still she was
      beginning to realise herself, her needs, her vague cravings. Her
      passionate desires now flowed into some definite channel&mdash;to escape
      at all costs from Durdleham, and consequently to enter that free world of
      art the glimpse of which had enchanted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenes between her sisters and herself were of daily occurrence. The
      narrower, gentler women were shocked at her wilfulnesses, her unladylike
      behaviour; she was revolted to her soul at the pettiness and sordidness of
      the disputes. Existence at Durdleham had become impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake, Gracie, let me go away from here,&rdquo; she cried one day, &ldquo;or
      I shall hate you&mdash;and I want to love you if I can. Let me go to
      London. Auntie will take me in. Oh, my God! I shall go mad in this place
      among you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Blather, for the sake of her own tranquillity and the reputation
      of the family, made up her mind that Clytie should have her desire and
      that Durdleham should know her no more. And in the end Mrs. Blather gained
      her father's consent to the arrangement; but the old man looked upon
      Clytie almost as a lost soul.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the eager
      young soul starts out unaided to solve the riddle of life, it meets with
      many paradoxes that admit of no solution, and many sordid simplicities
      that only unfamiliarity made it regard as enigmas. Despair in the one
      instance and disgust in the other not unfrequently drive it into a
      hopeless pessimism, in which inaction seems to be the least pain. Or else
      the soul bruises itself in vain against the mocking bars, shrinks in
      loathing from the disveiled corruption, and flies back to the unavailing
      aids that it spurned aforetime. It is cast in the valley of the shadow of
      death which only the stout-hearted can pass through unshaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The multitude stands by the formulas that profess to solve the eternal
      problem. It follows them blindly, like the schoolboy who cares not whether
      they are right or wrong, or whether the answer is conclusive. So long as
      there is an answer of some sort its mind is easy. But there are earnester
      inquirers whom these formulas do not satisfy&mdash;who see that they are
      followed for their own sake, that they never can lead to any conclusions.
      The soul, now of a people, now of an individual, rebels; it rejects the
      formulas; it starts from the first principles of being, asserting fiercely
      its individuality, its inalienable right to seek after truth according to
      its own methods. These are prejudiced. All great action must be. Because a
      system is rotten and incomplete the perfervid spirit judges that every
      factor must be false. It misses the fact that every great human system
      contains elemental truths of vital importance, without which it must fall
      in its struggle. And at last, when the forces of endeavour are well nigh
      spent, it finds the key of the great enigma inwrapped in a greater one
      still, in the eternal tragedy of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with this burning protest against formulas that
      Clytie entered into the world. They had been presented to her in their
      smug complacency as solving all mysteries human and divine. She had seen
      them worshipped as fetiches, and her soul revolted against the futile
      idolatry. She was too young to examine them carefully, to see that the
      sacrosanctity of some was miserably justified by human experience. She
      spurned them all, and she plunged into the waters of Life, a rudderless
      bark in search of the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spent two years in study at the Slade School in University College,
      living under the protection of her aunt, who had a house in Russell
      Square. The training was severe and at times irksome. But she learned
      strict academical rules of drawing, in spite of her repugnance to the
      stern coldness of the antique. After her term of hard training was over
      she went for a year into a painter's studio and learned colour and
      painting from the live model.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were years of probation, as Clytie well knew, and they brought her
      lessons in self-restraint, both in art and in the conduct of life. Her
      aunt, Miss Davenant, was shrewder and broader-minded than her brother,
      having lived more in the whirl of humanity, but the formulas of Durdleham
      were ranged as household gods upon her hearthstone, and Clytie, out of
      pure self-interest, was bound to show them outward respect. To compensate,
      however, for this, Clytie found in her student life many experiences, as
      she had found during her continental trip, with which she could fill her
      heart without violating her aunt's Lares and Penates.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seldom went to Durdleham. She had an odd feeling that she was in
      disgrace there for having wished to leave it. Besides, both Mrs. Blather
      and Janet, as is the inconsequent way of such women, spoke tauntingly of
      her gay life in town, and contrasted it enviously with their country
      dulness. And then, too, her father was always querulous, complaining, not
      of her absence from home, but of her dissimilarity to her sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear papa,&rdquo; she said one day, &ldquo;I could no more be like them than they
      could be like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might if you had tried,&rdquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie looked hopelessly out of window. What possible reply could be made?
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiest, most expansive hours that Clytie spent during these three
      years were in Harley Street with the Farquharsons. At first her aunt was
      rather averse to a continuance of the intimacy. Although she had kept up a
      visiting acquaintance with the Farquharsons since their return from
      Switzerland, and liked them both personally, she was conscious of an
      unfamiliar atmosphere in their house. The instinctive shrinking from the
      unknown made her seek to draw Clytie back with her towards the security of
      her own accustomed circle. But eventually, when she saw that the girl, to
      whom she had grown sincerely attached, found real happiness in going to
      Harley Street, she withdrew her tentative restrictions altogether. Perhaps
      she read deeper into the girl's heart than either was conscious of, and
      realised that in the Farquharsons' society Clytie found a relief from the
      strain of everyday life with her, which otherwise might have been
      unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conditions of the household in Harley Street were favourable to the
      development of unceremonious intimacy. Mrs. Farquharson herself was bred
      in that strange London world we call Bohemia. Her father, long since dead,
      had been a journalist, a hack story-writer, a maker of plays, sometimes
      editor of a smart weekly, at others acting manager of a provincial
      company. Like most men of his type he spent his money as fast as he earned
      it, and when work came to a temporary standstill drew upon the prospects
      of his next success. His daughter Caroline had grown up in cheerful
      familiarity with this hand to mouth, makeshift existence. She had been
      called upon so often from her earliest childhood to condone the faults of
      her father and those of his intimates, who were men of much the same mould
      as himself, that a general habit of indulgence became natural to her.
      Folly seemed so inherent a quality in humanity that not to smile
      tolerantly, even though reprovingly, upon it was with her an
      impossibility. The lowering of moral tone that might have resulted from
      this mental attitude, and from a continuance of the same conditions of
      life, was prevented by her early marriage with a man of assured income and
      position. Her father died shortly afterwards and her connection with the
      seamy side of Bohemianism was thoroughly broken off. But the ingrained
      habits of freedom and carelessness still remained. She could never learn
      to be methodical, systematic. She had an inherited dread of account-books,
      household rules, fixed hours for meals, and appointed places for every
      domestic article. It was fortunate for her that she had married a man who
      worshipped her, and himself shared her distaste for rigidly organised
      life. His means had placed him beyond the necessity of working for his
      livelihood, and so the free life in a home where he could work, idle, eat,
      and receive his friends at any hour of the day or night was as much to his
      own taste as to that of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible that such a house should not possess a charm for those
      to whom the Farquharsons gave their friendship. The absence of formality
      encouraged expansiveness and individuality. There was a tacit
      understanding that one had a right not only to oneself, but to the
      appreciation of oneself by the host and hostess. It was this that Clytie
      had felt during her first visit, and it attracted her more and more to
      them as time went on. Gradually the house became a second home to her, and
      Mrs. Farquharson a friend such as she had never known before. She could go
      to her for strength and comfort during her fits of depression when the
      time seemed out of joint, and she did not in the least seem called upon to
      set it right. The restraints of strict draughtsmanship, academic modelling
      and grouping, chafed her as her simple arithmetic had done at school. She
      longed to throw them off and to plunge back into her old artistic
      wilfulnesses. But these occasions generally coincided with fresh
      sensations of restraint in her home life, and she was wise enough to
      appreciate the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this period an incident occurred in her life, giving it fresh
      colour and helping her to realise herself more fully. Her girlhood had
      been far removed from the lax sphere of idle flirtation in which many
      girls are brought up. The young men of Durdleham, who might have been
      attracted towards her by her beauty, were frozen by her scarcely veiled
      impatience at their society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominant impulse towards active search after life had swayed her to
      the exclusion of any less powerful motive, and it had scarcely yet
      occurred to her that her personality might interest and possibly influence
      others. She was too absorbed in her work, in her dimly shadowed yet
      ever-haunting plans for the future, in the individualities round her, in
      the foretaste of that full sense of living, in the stirring objectivity of
      London life, to dwell at all earnestly on subjective matters and to devote
      much attention to self-analysis. It is only when the question, &ldquo;How do
      others affect me?&rdquo; ceases to interest that the other question, &ldquo;How does
      my personality affect others?&rdquo; begins to assume a paramount importance.
      The possibility of a man falling in love with her was a factor as yet
      absent from her scheme of practical life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She learned that such an event had occurred from Mrs. Farquharson. She had
      gone to her one Monday morning, depressed, out of tune, to seek
      consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why am I not a man?&rdquo; she exclaimed petulantly. &ldquo;Why can't I live by
      myself, go where I like, and see what I want to see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friend laughed good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to do too much at once, my dear. The world's your oyster, as
      ancient Pistol said, and you would force it open with one wrench. As for
      wishing to be a man, you are by no means original. Lots of girls say that,
      but when they grow older they think it's just as well for them that they
      are women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth's the good of being a <i>woman?</i>&rdquo; asked Clytie, with
      rather unnecessary emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of her studio companions had asked her to join a party at a theatre,
      and her aunt had demurred on the ground that ladies ought not to go to
      that particular house. It showed a certain knowledge of the world on the
      old lady's part, but Clytie did not realise it, and although she accepted
      the decision with good grace, it fretted her. These trivial things fret
      even the wisest amongst us quite as much as the important ones do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson did not reply, but continued placidly her usual Monday
      morning's occupation of putting her music in order, while Clytie watched
      her from the long rocking-chair where she was sitting, her hands clasped
      behind her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the good of being a woman when one has to pass half one's life
      shut up in darkness? It's bad enough being a human being as it is, and
      having to sleep the other half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you, my dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Farquharson, looking at a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; replied Clytie. &ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how would you like to be a young man of twenty&mdash;or even
      two-and-twenty? How would you like to be young Beaumont, for instance? Do
      you think he knows so very much more than you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's such a boy,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my dear, are such a girl,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson, coming up
      behind her chair and smoothing her cheeks. &ldquo;But you are many years older
      than he is&mdash;and likely to remain so. Do you know why we women like to
      be women? Because we see so many things that men would give the eyes of
      their heads to know. Hasn't it ever struck you that we are familiar with a
      side of life that is almost forever hidden from men? And as for that
      particular side that men have exclusively to themselves, it is neither
      very pretty nor comfortful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that is why men stop talking when one goes into the
      smoking-room,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;You hear shouts of laughter outside the door,
      and you think they must be having an awfully good time, and when you
      appear in the doorway they seem to pull themselves together, and one or
      two always look red and sheepish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should advise you to read the story of Bluebeard,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Farquharson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just as bad as the rest,&rdquo; cried Clytie, half laughing and half
      vexed. &ldquo;I never thought it of you. That's what I have always been told:
      Never try to find out what you don't know. Always remain in a state of
      blissful ignorance. Men are superior beings, and a good little girl ought
      to accept her position with meekness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could a tale unfold,&rdquo; said her friend, &ldquo;but I won't. It is too early
      for you. If you want to make experiments on your own account there is
      young Beaumont for you. He will tell you the sum total of his knowledge in
      ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I like him,&rdquo; said Clytie, leaving the main track of the
      conversation. &ldquo;He always looks so clean, and his clothes fit him so well,
      and he is so serviceable. He always seems to be trying to make the best of
      himself, since God has done so little for him. And it's very plucky of him
      to try to improve on the Almighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not like him too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Clytie! You haven't even got the elements of woman's knowledge
      yet. Can't you see why Beaumont wears those very chaste ties and those
      wonderfully shiny boots, and does errands all over London for you? Oh,
      dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that he&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson looked at her quizzically and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therefore I would not like him too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Obeying a first impulse, Clytie burst out laughing. It seemed so
      ridiculous. Beaumont was a good-looking, fresh-faced young fellow of
      two-and-twenty, a distant relation of the Farquharsons, and a habitué of
      the house. She had met him there many times and had begun to feel quite
      friendly towards him. Besides, he had fetched and carried for her in the
      most useful way. She had never thought of his falling in love with her. As
      he was the last man she herself would have thought of falling in love
      with, she found the event ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped laughing suddenly, and crimsoned to her hair; then rushed
      impulsively up to Mrs. Farquharson, and put her arm round her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry; forgive me. What must you think of me! I could not help it,
      indeed I couldn't. You put me in such a new light before myself. And, dear
      Mrs. Farquharson, I do so want you to see the best side of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; said her friend, &ldquo;you don't suppose that with your face
      and your nature you are going to pass through life without having men
      falling in love with you! You see what a lot you have to learn. You want
      to have a man's experiences before you have passed through the elementary
      ones of a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Beaumont&mdash;what shall I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don't fret yourself about him. He will get over it. He has no end of
      this sort of thing to go through before his life is up. It will do him
      good.&rdquo; Clytie had not much time to map out any fixed plan of treatment of
      her would-be lover, for he met her an afternoon or two afterwards outside
      University College, where he had been waiting for her, and pleaded that
      she would walk a little way up towards the Regent's Park, as the afternoon
      was fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie looked at him and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only just a little way. I have something I must tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you had best never tell it,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-waistcoated gate porter behind them beamed on them smilingly. He
      had seen something of youthful love in his professional career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must, whatever happens,&rdquo; replied the young fellow. &ldquo;I know it's wrong
      to ask you to walk in the street with me, but I don't know when I shall
      get another chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see anything wrong about it,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;I will go with you
      wherever you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they wandered up Gower Street and the Euston Road into the park, and
      there, for the first time in her life, Clytie heard a man confess his love
      for her and ask her to marry him. He was only a boy after all, but he was
      in great earnest. Clytie felt humbled, almost guilty, and yet a great,
      unknown pleasure thrilled through her. Although she knew that the sooner
      and more summarily the interview was brought to an end the better for both
      herself and him, she could scarcely resist the temptation of allowing him
      to pour out the fulness of his boyish love for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly found herself listening to the sound but not the meaning of
      his words, her senses filled with the sweetness of the new sensations and
      the pure May sunlight that flooded the trees and the gay flower-bed
      opposite the bench where they were sitting. Then she realised her
      situation, and in a few kind words, harder to speak than she would have
      expected, dismissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was the end of the matter. He went off whither young men in his
      predicament generally betake themselves, and Clytie returned slowly home
      to Russell Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had reached her own room she went deliberately up to the glass
      and scanned her features. Then she laughed a strange, contented little
      laugh, and taking off her hat and gloves, went downstairs to tea. She had
      advanced several steps along the road to knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years! How quickly they passed! How sure yet dimly working were
      their influences! If they were years of probation and self-restraint for
      Clytie, they also brought with them softening influences. Hitherto her
      life had been one of revolt and harsh, crude judgments that had turned
      away friendship and had left her solitary. Mutual misconception and
      misunderstanding had crushed sisterly love. Her heart had never been
      touched by real affection. Now she had friends, real ones, in the
      Farquharsons whom she could love for their own sakes, and pleasant,
      sympathetic ones in her companions at the Slade School and at the studio.
      She learned, too, the sweetness of active protection and helpfulness. Her
      aunt, though somewhat stronger-fibred than the rest of the Davenants,
      possessed their essential physical characteristics. Her health, which had
      been failing for some years, gradually gave way altogether. During the few
      months of her last illness she depended entirely upon Clytie for care and
      tenderness. It was a new, strange experience for the girl. She learned to
      love the faded elderly lady who bore her sufferings so calmly, so
      cheerfully. Both Mrs. Blather and Janet offered to come and nurse her, but
      Miss Davenant would have none but Clytie. If this period of selflessness
      and sacrifice had lasted, who knows what sweet effacement of individuality
      might have resulted? Who knows into what channels of pity and sublime
      endeavours of mercy the girl's full, ardent nature might have been
      directed? But the high gods had ordained otherwise. Miss Davenant died,
      and Clytie again found herself with the unknown destiny before her that
      had to be worked out unaided.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only after the first outburst of grief that she realised this
      fully. She had gone back to Durdleham, with a new range of feelings
      freshly revealed. Her sisters she found were gentle, quiet women like her
      aunt, narrower perhaps, with thin currents of old prejudice still running
      through them, but still lovable and sympathetic in her sorrow. They
      welcomed her back like a lost sheep to the fold. Never had her home life
      seemed so peaceful, comfortful; London was scarcely mentioned, and her
      sisters agreed between themselves that Clytie's absence from home was an
      episode of the past, never to recur.
    </p>
    <p>
      But time wears and effaces the deepest intaglio of impression, even that
      of a young girl's first knowledge of death and eternal loss. Gradually the
      quietude of eventless life, as the need for it wore away, grew wearisome,
      oppressive, and the old restless cravings began to gnaw at her heart. The
      breach that death had closed slowly widened again, so gradually that not
      till it was fully appreciable did the sisters recognise it. The formulas
      seemed narrower, more lifeless than ever. She had viewed dimly the
      potentialities of life, and her soul burned within her with a fiercer
      hunger. Almost against her will she revolted finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this that Janet has been telling me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blather one
      morning, &ldquo;about your wanting to go back to London? You cannot be in
      earnest, Clytie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie looked at her sister rather sadly, tears springing into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been very good to me since I have come back, Gracie, and I have
      learned to love you more than I did before&mdash;much more. But can't you
      understand, dear, that if I am to go on loving you I must go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see it at all,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Blather. &ldquo;If we have got on so
      nicely together these last few months, why can't we continue? Janet and I
      are willing to give you all in our power to make you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but don't you see that what I want is out of your power to give?&rdquo;
       said Clytie. &ldquo;Don't think I am wicked and ungrateful. If a man wants five
      pounds, he is grateful to anyone who gives him one; but that does not
      lessen his need of the other four. Now the other four pounds are not to be
      got in Durdleham, Gracie, and I must have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should learn content, Clytie,&rdquo; said her sister. &ldquo;We have all to put
      up with our lot in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie checked an impulse of impatience at the platitude, and answered
      with great gentleness of voice and manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not my lot in life, dear. It is quite different. You and Janet
      can bear it, because your natures crave this tranquillity. Mine craves
      movement, excitement, strange faces. Oh, Gracie, it is no use talking&mdash;I
      must go away, or I shall begin to hate Durdleham as I used to do. There is
      nothing for me to do here. I am too bad for it, perhaps. I don't know. I
      can't explain it to you; you have never felt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Clytie, that is all nonsense,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blather, who prided
      herself, above all things, on being a woman of common sense. &ldquo;As a matter
      of fact, you can't go to London, because you would have no one to live
      with, and you would only have your hundred a year to support you, as papa
      has lost a great deal of money lately and can hardly afford to give you an
      allowance. When your aunt was alive it was a different thing. The whole
      idea of going to live alone in London is silly. So there's an end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blather went on with her sewing, with mingled feelings of content at
      having done her duty and disappointment in the failure of promise of
      reform in Clytie. She would have judged her sister mercifully had she been
      able. She was naturally a gentle woman, full of kindness. But her canons
      of duty would not allow her to encourage or condone wilfulness, caprice,
      and a tendency to wrong-doing. She earnestly believed it was for Clytie's
      good to stay in Durdleham. The girl's wider needs she could not
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie turned from the hearthrug, where she had been standing, to the
      drawing-room window, and looked out blankly at the rain. Her young face
      was set rather hard; her lips quivered a little; her heart beat quicker
      than usual. A struggle was taking place within her&mdash;the struggle
      between the girl and the woman. She felt that the great moment of her life
      had come. She must choose. Which should it be: the dazzling light with its
      weird shadows of things unseen, or the gray, easeful glimmer in which the
      familiar realities cast no shadow? Which should it be: daughterly duty and
      maidenly retirement, or the sundering of home ties forever and going out,
      one woman, to battle with the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from the window at last and called to her sister. The
      latter looked up and was filled with foreboding as she saw the girl's pale
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What is the matter, Clytie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made up my mind, Gracie,&rdquo; she said a little huskily. &ldquo;I am going
      to London to live by myself. I can share lodgings with one of the girls I
      know at the Slade School. There will be no difficulty. I can earn money; I
      have already earned a little. As for mamma's money, I am of age now, and
      it is my own to do what I like with it&mdash;as you and Janet do. Let this
      be an end of the discussion, Gracie. I am going.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ew people, in an
      outburst of enthusiasm, would select the King's Road, Chelsea, as an ideal
      locality to reside in. It is an important thoroughfare, no doubt, but it
      lacks nobility and distinction. There are isolated, quiet spots in it,
      with houses lying back from the road; and from the upper windows of
      favoured residences one can obtain a view over Yeitch's or Bull's
      extensive hothouses, and catch dim shadows of great tropical palms and a
      mellowed dash of brilliant red and yellow. There are others which look
      over Portman Square or St. Luke's Churchyard. But on the other hand, there
      are long stretches of dreary shops and factories, grit and general
      uncomeliness. Without being squalid, it has a careworn, untidy appearance,
      as if it was far too much harassed with the petty worries and strain of
      workaday life to think of cheerful adornment. Few people, except errand
      boys whose sense either of aesthetics or duty is usually undeveloped,
      saunter casually along the King's Road. A stranger tries to get out of it
      as fast as he can; a frequenter has his business to attend to. Fashion
      does not pass along it, except on tearing drags bound for Hurlingham. It
      is essentially a small bourgeois part of London, with all the small
      bourgeois unpretence and honest, if somewhat dismal, solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the middle of such a dreary stretch of the road, some half mile
      west of Sloane Square, that Clytie found a lodging. The fact that a
      green-grocer's shop, owned by the landlord of the house, occupied the
      ground floor was compensated, in a measure, by the existence of a small
      studio at the back, on the first floor, originally constructed by a
      struggling photographer, who had since worked his way upwards into a more
      fashionably perfumed atmosphere. One of Clytie's favourite
      fellow-students, Winifred Marchpane, who lived in Lower Sloane Street, and
      whose family obtained their potatoes and salads from Mr. Gurkins, had
      recommended the establishment, and offered to share with her the expenses
      of the studio. The cheapness of the rooms suited Clytie's modest purse,
      and the prospect of pleasant companionship in the studio was an additional
      attraction. It is true that the acrid smell of the potatoes, when the side
      door from the shop on to the private entrance lobby was left open,
      ascended the stairs, together with a vague odour of cooking, bearing
      upwards, as it were, on savoury breath the disputes of Mrs. Gurkins with
      the shopboy and the cries of her apparently ever-youthful progeny. The
      incessant rumble, too, of omnibuses, drays, and furniture vans, and the
      peculiarly aggressive rattle of tradesmen's carts, shook the floor and the
      windows and shivered the lustres of the chandelier. There were many
      drawbacks to elegant life, but Clytie, borrowing some philosophy from a
      talk with Mrs. Farquharson, proceeded to disregard those she could not
      eliminate. The sitting-room, when the door was shut and the curtains drawn
      of an evening, was cosy enough. The pictures, nicknacks, hangings, and
      other minor accessories of furnished apartments Clytie had returned to
      Mrs. Gurkins' keeping, on the plea that she scarcely had room for her own&mdash;which
      was true; and, by some miraculous art of persuasion, she had induced Mr.
      Gurkins to remove the nerve-shattering chandelier, on the ground that she
      could not work by gaslight&mdash;which was not true. She hung thick
      curtains over the door to keep out noise and odour, broke up the rigidity
      of the furniture by screens, small tables, and plants, and painted a long
      panel for the old cottage piano that made it look fresh and companionable.
      When all the arrangements were completed the room appeared dainty and
      homelike, bearing, however, here and there, in bold notes of colour, folds
      of drapery, and odd bits of semi-impressionist painting, a peculiar
      impress of its tenant's personality.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was living at last the life she had so passionately longed for. There
      was not a human being to control her actions, not a conventionality to
      check the utterance of her thoughts. During her early days here she almost
      felt tempted to hang up her latchkey over the mantelpiece as a glorious
      symbol of liberty. It seemed not only to serve to give her entrance to her
      own modest home, but to be the power that would unlock the heart of the
      great London that lay before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first she had little difficulty in finding work. Dealers bought
      small pictures and gave her orders. She also pleased a firm of publishers
      to whom she had gone with letters of introduction and specimens of her
      draughtsmanship, and obtained work in the way of book and magazine
      illustrating. Her earnings were not large, but there was the promise of
      success to come. At the end of two years her income was large enough to
      have enabled her to move from the King's Road into a more refined
      locality; but she had grown accustomed to its noise and rattle, and to the
      hurried, joyless stream of life that flowed along it day by day. And Mrs.
      Gurkins understood her tastes and habits, a quality in a landlady
      appreciated by women as well as men. So she stayed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read widely during these years, learned much. Between the ages of
      twenty-two and twenty-four a woman is capable of vast assimilation of
      ideas. They can flow into the freshly opened, unpolluted channels of her
      being, as yet unclogged by the refuse of sorrows and wearinesses. Her
      rejection of the old formulas, and the paramount necessity of gaining
      knowledge wherewith to provide herself substitutes, checked in her any
      impulse towards moral or artistic idealism. She read deeply, instinctively
      seeking after the roots of life, the elemental passions that shake our
      nature, be its superstructure never so delicately complex. The dawning
      knowledge half frightened, half attracted her. The barbaric feminine in
      her struggled to escape into solitude. With fluttering eyelids downcast it
      recoiled from the idea of passion as yet unawakened responsively within
      her. But the higher needs of modernity constrained her to a just, resolute
      system of inquiry. She learned that there are deeper laws regulating our
      being than those which could be enunciated at Durdleham tea-tables, where
      the ingrained habit of non-recognition of them restricted life within
      narrowest limits, and put, as it were, a prohibition tax upon exoteric
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four-and-twenty Clytie was a woman&mdash;emotional, impulsive, eager to
      taste of any new experience. The old rebellious habit of mind had
      developed into a frank independence. Her step was elastic, her bearing
      confident. Her life was full and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad I am a woman now,&rdquo; she said to Mrs. Farquharson. &ldquo;I seem to
      have all the advantages of both sexes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you're married, my dear,&rdquo; replied her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson was fond of the use of affectionate irritants. They are
      often valuable preservatives of friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall marry some day. I don't want to end up by leading half
      a life; but I want to have two or three years more of this. I must play at
      being a man a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty sort of man!&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson, resting her chin on her
      hand and looking at Clytie with amused eyes. &ldquo;You are the most deliciously
      feminine young woman I know. Look at your frock and your hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judging by outward appearances Mrs. Farquharson's criticism was correct.
      Clytie had the artistic sense in dress. It was like most of her other
      artistic impulses, with the personal note dominant&mdash;soft textures,
      falling easily into folds, quiet in tone, dark grays, subdued half shades
      of yellows, suddenly brightened by a small, daring flash of colour at
      throat or bosom. Lace, with its creamy, clinging softness delighted her,
      and she wore it defiantly, with a certain sense of triumph that she was
      perhaps the only girl in England who could wear it with faultless taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was of medium height, but her slender, fully formed figure and its
      erect carriage gave her an air of tallness. Her head set well on her
      shoulders, and a habit of holding it back, with the chin pointing upwards,
      free of the throat, added to the impression of young, fearless womanhood.
      Her eyes were dark blue, wide apart, yet sunk in finely moulded orbits. A
      light of humour playing in their depths, together with a soft modelling of
      the nose contours beneath them, atoned for an impression of hardness and
      sensuousness that would have been given by the ripe, full lips with their
      little curl of disdain. Her face was rounded delicately&mdash;that much
      she inherited from the Davenants&mdash;but a faint flush of colour showed
      the buoyant young blood within, just as her deep red hair, with a thousand
      lights dancing in it, attested the rich, vigorous strain that had asserted
      itself in her. She was proud, womanlike, of this hair, and had a way of
      dressing it in bewildering confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Slade School friend, Winifred Marchpane, continued to share the studio
      with her. At first she had been a little afraid of Clytie, whose bold
      judgments and fearless expression of opinion were not qualified always to
      attract a timorous, shrinking nature. But gradually the stronger
      personality had overpowered the weaker and bound it to itself by
      unbreakable bonds. A great friendship had thus arisen between the girls,
      based on Winifred's side on enthusiastic admiration, almost worship, and
      on Clytie's on a tender feeling of love and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred was one of a large family, her father, a retired officer in the
      army with limited income. Two of her sisters were governesses, earning
      their livelihood miles away from home. Another one took charge of the
      smaller members of the household. Winifred, who had a dainty talent for
      the painting of still life, supported herself, living at home and paying
      her share of the household expenses. She was a little, gentle creature,
      with dark hair, and with a rich colour showing beneath a brown cheek. Her
      deep brown eyes had a doglike trustfulness in them, and a steadfastness
      withal such as makes the heroine. A girl of few moods, few caprices. Her
      work was always beautifully, conscientiously finished. She always loved
      it, always found in it the same quiet charm. There was no element of
      passion in it to set jarring the strings of futile endeavour. A fine sense
      of colour and gradation and subtle curve, a supreme delicacy of touch&mdash;that
      was her sole artistic stock in trade, and she never sought to stray beyond
      the limits imposed. She had had a little picture accepted at the Academy,
      hung in a far, far corner&mdash;a bunch of Maréchal Niel roses,
      full-blown, in a Venetian glass vase of exquisitely veined transparencies&mdash;a
      perfect little picture, sweet and pure, like herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold March day. The sun shone cheerfully through the drawn white
      blinds of the studio skylight, but an east wind blowing outside came in
      through the cracks and defied the blaze of the fire in the stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite blue with cold,&rdquo; said Winifred, laying down mahl-stick and
      palette. &ldquo;Here, put on this wrap. Why don't you take more care of
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of it,&rdquo; said Clytie, shivering a little and accepting
      contentedly the wrap and a caress. &ldquo;I was sketching out quite a history of
      that boy who has just left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred drew a stool to Clytie's chair near the fire and took up her
      position upon it&mdash;a favourite one with her, as she could have both
      the moral solace of sitting at Clytie's feet, and the physical comfort of
      resting her head in Clytie's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he won't bring all kinds of horrible people into the house&mdash;burglars,
      you know, like Oliver Twist,&rdquo; she added vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is rather rash picking up a model out of the streets. But he
      is just the boy I wanted to give character to the group. I was going to
      paint in one out of my own head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how you get all those street types out of your head, Clytie.
      I wish I could do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to see you try, you silly child,&rdquo; said Clytie, laughing.
      &ldquo;Your street arabs would look like stray Cupids hastily huddled up in old
      clothes by a shocked and modest policeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean that; you know I didn't. What I meant was&mdash;I wish I
      could paint without models. I don't think I could paint a common flat leaf
      without having it before me. As for painting that&rdquo;&mdash;and she pointed
      to a basket standing by her easel, overflowing with anemones, snowdrops,
      and violets obtained that morning by Mr. Gurkins from Covent Garden&mdash;&ldquo;without
      a copy, I might just as soon think of flying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an artist, Winnie, and love your art for its own sake. I am not
      quite so sure that I do, now. To have to finish all the thousand little
      convolutions of those bells would drive me raving mad. I should like to
      have a ghost as sculptors do, only mine would do the finishing and put in
      all the nuisance of detail. That's why I can get on without models. It
      saves time. I can bring home a face with me from the streets, and I can
      paint it in rapidly, and then I am done. I suppose I oughtn't to be, but
      Burrowes seems satisfied. He says he has got quite a 'line' in my pictures&mdash;the
      correct ones&mdash;and is thinking of raising the price. I am sure that
      man has been a linen-draper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could remember the boy's face why do you bring him here?&rdquo; asked
      Winifred. &ldquo;I only want to know why you want him so particularly, dear,&rdquo;
       she added, raising her chin and looking upwards at Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had been ragged and uncared-for, not exactly a street urchin, but
      on a vague borderland of respectability, between the newspaper arab and
      the errand boy.&mdash;a hybrid with the vices of many strains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really want to know, Winnie?&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;Perhaps you'll be
      shocked. However, you'll have to know sooner or later: I am going to make
      a picture of him on my own account, just a little bit more fantastic than
      he is, and call him a&mdash;an&mdash;oh, dear! what shall I call him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An elf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, no. What have I to do with elves and fairies and that sort
      of thing? He is the son of Cophetua&mdash;supposing the king had not
      married the beggar maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not the son of any other king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not, indeed?&rdquo; said Clytie drily. &ldquo;Or of any other beggar maid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Winifred, looking into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then after a pause:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see his mother? I did. Such a stupid-looking, red-faced woman. I
      think she said she was a charwoman by profession. There are generations of
      drudgery in her face, whereas in Jack's there is vigour and intelligence&mdash;something
      so different; he must have some better strain of blood in him than she and
      a husband of her class can have given him. Don't you think so, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a very pretty boy,&rdquo; replied Winifred, &ldquo;but, oh, he is so dirty and&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a shudder&mdash;&ldquo;so animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he fascinates me,&rdquo; said Clytie meditatively. &ldquo;I am going to paint
      one of my wildest pictures&mdash;all for my own self&mdash;and a bit for
      you if you like, Winnie.&rdquo; Winnie accepted this tribute of affection with a
      little flush of pleasure, although Clytie's &ldquo;own&rdquo; pictures seldom gave her
      unqualified æsthetic delight, and turned her face towards Clytie, who
      laughed in her frank way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look at me with those great eyes of yours, child! You make me angry
      for you. They are just the sort of eyes that make women miserable. You
      must not trust in people like that, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I trust them when they are good like you, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you mustn't. Don't you know I am the wickedest girl going&mdash;always
      thinking of the most dreadful things? Look at the wall. How can you love
      anybody that can do these silly things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pointed to a series of grotesque charcoal caricatures on the studio
      wall. She had been dissatisfied a day or two back with a picture she had
      been engaged on for a month, and in a fit of wilfulness had daubed it out
      and then proceeded to make a cruel, fantastic travesty of it on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted your tea, dear, just as you do now,&rdquo; replied Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tea hour was Winifred's great delight. At home, on account of the
      children, they had to sit round the dining table and butter their own
      thick slices of bread and drink out of substantial breakfast cups. In the
      studio the girls had provided a dainty little afternoon tea equipage, and
      Mrs. Gurkins always cut thin bread and butter from a fancy loaf. Generally
      it was Winifred who poured out the tea, but to-day Clytie busied herself
      with the cups, thus making some slight amends, perhaps, for having shocked
      Winifred. Women are full of these odd feminine impulses, and other women
      understand them. Men don't.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat talking, as they usually did, over their tea, and long
      afterwards, until it was time for Winifred to go home. As they were taking
      leave of each other on the landing a man sprang up the stairs, checked
      himself, and raised a slouch hat as he passed them and vanished up the
      next flight. He was a fresh-faced man, with a brown and tawny beard; tawny
      ends, too, to his moustaches; bright gray eyes flashing humourously as he
      passed the girls. His dress was careless, loose and unfashionable, yet it
      was marked with a certain individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Winifred whispered when the last foot of the ascending
      figure had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's another protest,&rdquo; said Clytie&mdash;&ldquo;a better one. He has the
      courage of his convictions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Clytie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, can't you recognise a protest when you see one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Clytie, don't tease and puzzle me,&rdquo; cried Winifred, giving her
      friend's arm a little shake. &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. How should I? But Mrs. Gurkins was telling me about him
      only this morning. His name is Kent. He seems to frighten the life out of
      her, and therefore I say he is a protest. Now you know, so run away home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Winifred had reached the street door Clytie leaned over the banisters
      and called after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winnie! I must have been in a sweet temper this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, dear. Why do you say so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you have left your basket of anemones for me to take care of!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Winifred had
      gone Clytie took an omnibus to Cheyne Walk, where some friends of hers
      lived, and after her visit returned to her solitary dinner. It argued some
      strength of mind in Clytie that she did not give way, as many lonely women
      do, to a distaste for ordinary food, and a corresponding craving for the
      miscellaneous and not over wholesome meal denominated high tea. She had
      not reached the stage of feminine depression and sense of helplessness
      when inchoate banqueting on bread and butter and penny buns seems to bring
      cheerless solace. Her temperament seemed almost virile in its vigour, and
      although she had her sex's antipathy to gastronomy, she nevertheless found
      it reasonable that she should be provided with a decently served dinner.
      Besides, Mrs. Gurkins, who was professionally interested in food stuffs,
      held solid views on the subject. She herself had a good appetite, and her
      little girl children ate everything they could lay their little white
      teeth to; she did not believe in not being hungry. It was one of her
      grievances that her other lodger, Mr. Kent upstairs, cooked his own
      victuals scramblingly, and would not allow her to see that his wants were
      duly satisfied. Accordingly she bestowed extra care upon Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the cloth was removed Clytie continued the book she had been reading
      during the meal, and at last flung it aside. She rose and walked about the
      room, somewhat restless. She felt lonely&mdash;vaguely desirous of action,
      and yet idle. Was it a dumb premonition of fate, this restlessness? At any
      rate it led her to perform a trivial action which set in motion the
      currents of her future life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down at her writing table that stood in the recess between the
      fireplace and the light-curtained window and lit a couple of candles,
      whose pretty red paper shades threw a rosy glow around the corner of the
      room. It was only a simple note that she scribbled, hastily, boldly, as
      was her wont. Then she left the candles burning, and returned to her
      armchair by the fire and gave herself up to meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy model she had engaged that morning interested' her powerfully. She
      shrank from an insistence upon the solution of the little problem she had
      offered to Winifred during the afternoon, hovering over and away from it.
      Her sense of type and personality was too acute not to be profoundly
      struck by the difference between his mother and himself. On the one hand
      was dulness, commonness, a coarse-fibred nature responsive to the
      stirrings of neither hope nor despair, a dull, uncomplaining drudge; on
      the other hand a quick, fiery temperament, showing itself in flashing
      black eyes, delicate nostrils, wiry, curly brown hair&mdash;all made
      picturesque by unqualified dirt. And yet, despite this refinement of
      feature, there was cruelty, brutality even, written on the childish face.
      That might be the fault of his upbringing, thought Clytie. But his beauty&mdash;where
      did it come from? She smiled as she thought of King Cophetua. It was the
      beggar maiden's grace that had won the king's heart, and grace was a
      quality that Jack's mother most distinctly lacked. Clytie felt dimly
      conscious of being on the verge of an appalling discovery. Her reading had
      been catholic enough, and her independent acquaintance with life
      sufficiently broad, to render the fact familiar to her that kings and
      beggar maidens if they fall in love with each other usually dispense with
      the ceremony of marriage. But then love pardons all&mdash;a formula in
      Clytie's new theory of social statics, perhaps wisely not accepted in
      Durdleham&mdash;and all the sorrow in lawlessness that had come within
      Clytie's small experience had been in her eyes sanctified by love. Yet who
      could have loved this woman? She was not more than three-and-thirty now&mdash;young
      enough to show that she had never possessed the mere attraction of
      comeliness. The boy remained, however, a living proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought of Winifred, and sighed a little. Why should she be forever
      craving after this strange hidden knowledge, after the taste of things
      bitter, when there was so much sweetness in life? The thought of
      Winifred's pure, gentle touch in flowers and delicate bloom of fruit and
      calm, transparent glass came over her like a rebuke. And then she smiled
      again, remembering how Winifred had coaxed her once to try and paint a
      bunch of roses, and how dismayed she had been at the egregious failure.
      No; the cobbler must not go beyond his last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose I am very wicked after all,&rdquo; she said to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rested her chin upon her hand and let her thoughts wander idly,
      building up a romance for Jack. He was a foundling, of noble parents, and
      Mrs. Burmester was only his foster mother. Then she roused herself with a
      little exclamation of disgust:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a perfectly Durdleham solution!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next moment, with an instinct common to folks whether at Durdleham or
      London, she sprang from her chair and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's something burning!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The room in fact was full of thin smoke, and, as Clytie rose, a snake of
      red flame ran up the curtains by the writing-desk. She rushed to them, but
      as soon as she had touched them, the folds being shaken out, the whole
      burst into a blaze. She fled to the door about to scream &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; at the
      top of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened next neither she nor John Kent could afterwards exactly
      explain. He was on his way downstairs when the door was suddenly thrown
      open and a stream of light burst on to the gloomy landing. Clytie ran
      almost into his arms crying, &ldquo;My room is on fire!&rdquo; and then he was tearing
      down blazing, fiery curtains, smothering them with rugs, and stamping out
      glowing masses of drapery amid much smoke and confusion. It did not take
      very long to extinguish the flames, but the struggle while it lasted was
      fierce and exciting. Clytie stood by watching him, her hand at her throat.
      It was a new sensation to her to have a man acting for her in an
      emergency. She had failed. She saw by the man's energy, his fearless
      dealing with the blazing mass, his strength, his violence, that she never
      could have succeeded. She admired him, was angry at it; felt herself a
      helpless woman, was angry at that too; wished that the danger had been a
      little greater, at which she was more angry than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when the last traces of the fire were extinguished, and the man
      stood before her, somewhat out of breath, wiping his forehead, this little
      train of emotions came to an end. She gazed piteously at her curtainless
      windows and scorched wainscoting. He turned and opened the window, whence
      the damp, gusty wind whirled the smoke in billowing drifts about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, with a breath of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can I thank you?&rdquo; said Clytie. + &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; he replied with
      cheerful laconism. &ldquo;I am glad I was handy&mdash;for your sake as well as
      my own. I live upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; I have seen you come in and out. In fact, you passed us to-day.
      But still you have saved the whole house, and I thank you very, very
      much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did it all happen?&rdquo; he asked, removing for the first time his white
      slouch hat and disclosing a shock of brown curly hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The candle-shade on the desk; do you see? It must have caught fire and
      toppled over on to the curtains. I was sitting here and forgot I had left
      the candles alight; and then I smelled something burning and saw the
      curtains in a blaze. Then I ran out to call somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very stupid,&rdquo; said Kent, pushing back the desk from the middle
      of the room, where he had wheeled it; &ldquo;by opening the door you made the
      things burn quicker. All you had to do was to drag down the curtains and
      cover them with the hearthrug. And then it is very silly to use paper
      candle-shades. They are no good, and they are always causing accidents. I
      hope you are not going to get any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assured paternal air with which Kent delivered himself of this little
      speech did away with its apparent rudeness. Clytie, who at first looked
      rather resentfully at her rebuker, laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bent down together to restore order among the singed rugs. Beneath
      them was Kent's waterproof, on to which he had thrown the blazing
      curtains. It was very badly burned and of course rendered useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is utterly ruined!&rdquo; exclaimed Clytie, examining the holes with a
      helpless expression of regret on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then her eyes suddenly fell upon a great ugly red splash upon his
      hand. He withdrew it hastily, but she caught the sleeve of his coat. The
      stuff came away between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have burned yourself horribly. Oh, what can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;It doesn't hurt. I'll go and put something on
      it. Please don't trouble. Goodnight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved towards the door, with his hat and burned waterproof in his hand.
      But Clytie could not let him leave in this way. The woman in her was
      moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please don't go until I have seen what harm you have got. I should
      feel so unhappy about it. I may be able to dress it for you&mdash;until
      you can see a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke so sincerely, so frankly, and looked at him with such genuine
      concern, that he surrendered with a good grace. He came forward to the
      table where the big lamp was burning and put out his arm for her
      inspection. It was really injured, and was beginning to be exceedingly
      painful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do for it?&rdquo; she asked rather helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, some olive oil and a bit of rag will be the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie produced some cotton wool and some oil from a cruet in the
      sideboard and then sought after some linen to bandage with. Kent noticed
      that she did not ask him for his handkerchief, nor did she use her own,
      but went rather impulsively to a workbasket and tore off a strip of soft
      material that was lying on the top. It was very expensive stuff, and the
      whole piece of work of which it was to form a part was spoiled. It was
      characteristic of her. Another woman would have remembered where she had
      stored some odds and ends of old linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent watched her curiously as she was bending over his hand. He had often
      seen her before, but his life went on so far outside the sphere of women
      that he had scarcely given her a thought as he had passed her by. He had
      never even inquired her name. From the mere fact of her renting the studio
      it had come involuntarily to his knowledge that she followed pursuits more
      or less artistic; but his curiosity had never been aroused. Now that he
      had been suddenly thrown into close contact with her he was interested. He
      smiled at himself for the unwonted pleasure he found in watching the
      lights dancing through her hair, the brows contracted ever so little in
      the absorption of her occupation, the long nervous fingers, set on the
      broad palm, deftly arranging the cotton wool, the scrap of old lace at her
      throat and wrists. She was pretty, striking, to look upon, but he had not
      formed a very high impression of her otherwise. It was just the sort of
      thing a woman would do, to run out of the room when it was on fire, to
      give up thinking for herself in any emergency and trust blindly in
      Providence&mdash;or a man. It is a strange thing that those men who see
      least of women know most concerning them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she raised her head after pinning the bandage she caught the expression
      of amusement on his face. He was quick to note the little shadow of
      resentment that passed over hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking what a mess I should have made of it by myself,&rdquo; he said
      with a tact that surprised him. &ldquo;Thank you very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was the least I could do,&rdquo; replied Clytie. &ldquo;I feel so guilty about it
      all&mdash;and your poor waterproof too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a very old one,&rdquo; he replied good-humouredly, holding the garment out
      for inspection. &ldquo;My friends will be delighted. They have threatened to cut
      me in the streets if they saw me in it again. So you see you have secured
      my friendship for me. And I shall get on much better with an umbrella
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're surely not going out to-night!&rdquo; cried Clytie, moving to the
      window and shutting it, as if he were intending to escape through it. &ldquo;It
      is pouring wet, and you would catch cold in your hand&mdash;it would get
      inflamed, or something dreadful. It is stupid of people not to take care
      of themselves. It's hurting fearfully, isn't it? Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him so frankly, her head thrown back a little, and spoke
      with such a faint touch of imperiousness in her voice, that Kent checked
      his impulse of retreat. &ldquo;Of course it hurts. But I don't mind. If one
      minded all the little pains of this life, one would have no time for
      anything else. Besides, I am used to rough it a bit. It is my own choice,
      more or less, and I like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie remembered the strange stories Mrs. Gurkins had told her about
      Kent's way of life. She had listened to them with idle interest, never
      imagining that Kent and herself would ever become acquainted. Now that he
      alluded to his habits she felt bound to confess her share in the gossip,
      which she did somewhat rebelliously, checking certain more timorous
      promptings of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see I know all about you,&rdquo; she said in conclusion. &ldquo;When people
      are eccentric they become, as it were, public characters. Now if you were
      to talk to Mrs. Gurkins&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens forbid!&rdquo; cried Kent with much warmth. &ldquo;I was fleeing from her
      this afternoon when I nearly knocked you down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Clytie, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;instinct, I suppose. Perhaps I have been wrong.
      Otherwise I might have known something more of you. It's a bad compliment,
      I am aware, but I have been here a whole year and I have never seen or
      heard your name. Might I know whom I have had the pleasure of assisting? I
      did not in the least care before, but now it is different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an honesty and directness in his voice that pleased Clytie. She
      felt glad he had asked her. There is a touch of susceptible vanity even in
      the most emancipated of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Davenant, and I am by way of being an artist&mdash;that is to
      say, I gain my living by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes wandered unconsciously round the room hung with many of her
      half-finished sketches. Kent followed her glance, and then crossed to the
      wall and examined one or two of the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are these yours?&rdquo; he asked, turning round quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were charcoal sketches of street scenes, direct and daring. Kent
      received Clytie's nod of assent, and glanced at the pictures and then at
      her again, as if trying to reconcile the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is all your work of this kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mostly. Sometimes I draw it milder,&rdquo; she added, with a smile, &ldquo;when
      definite orders come in; but I feel more at home with this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent returned to the centre of the room, where he had been standing
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not an artist myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have been brought up in an
      atmosphere of art and I love it. My father was Rupert Kent,
      painter-etcher; he did that little thing over your mantelpiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it a perfect little piece of work?&rdquo; said Clytie, looking round at
      it. &ldquo;I am very fond of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So was my father. Well, you see, I am not a Philistine in art matters,
      and when I say your work interests me I mean it. I should like to look at
      some more of it. Where is it to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can come anytime to my studio if you like. It is my place of
      business, you know, and perhaps you may get me some orders. Art is
      terribly mercenary in these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see the things you do for yourself,&rdquo; said Kent bluntly,
      ignoring the little hedge wherewith she had fenced her invitation. &ldquo;It
      will be very kind of you to let me come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie held out her hand to him as he bade her goodnight and thanked him
      for his help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now that we know each other,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I hope&mdash;I hope you
      won't cut me on the stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone Clytie looked ruefully at the damage that had been done.
      Her pretty inside curtains were destroyed; the heavy outer ones burned
      into great charred holes. The carpet and hearthrug were badly scorched,
      and the side of her writing-table warped and blistered. As she gazed at
      the wreck she went over the little scene in her mind. Why had she stood
      still, leaving the whole of the work to Kent? What must he have thought of
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been any ordinary man of her acquaintance she would have been
      still angry with herself for her helplessness, and her anger would have
      reflected itself on him. But now she put the question to herself more
      through curiosity than irritation. There was a simplicity about the man
      that attracted her. His words had been blunt, almost rude sometimes, but
      his voice had been kind, his manner protective, straightforward. She had
      signally marked her approbation for him by asking him to visit her studio,
      a privilege she only accorded to a few tried and very sympathetic men
      friends. Kent interested her, and yet she had not the slightest desire to
      transfer her impression of him to canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning she gave Winifred an account of the last evening's
      incidents, confessing her own impressions in her wilful, half-cynical way.
      Her friend listened meekly, wondering at her earnestness. The curtains had
      caught fire, a gentleman had come opportunely to her aid, had burned his
      hand, which she had tended in common courtesy. It was all so very natural.
      As for feeling humiliated at being helped by a man, what are women put in
      the world for except to yield and give way before men?
    </p>
    <p>
      But Winifred did not say this to Clytie.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ohn Kent,
      antiquarian, scientist, Bohemian, and assistant curator in the British
      Museum, dwelt in the attics, far above the limit of the stair carpet. By
      the time you had reached them you had lost all sound of the thoroughfare
      below, and even when you looked out of the windows all sense of locality
      was lost. Nothing could be seen but roofs and chimney-pots, except on very
      clear days, when, through an accidental vista of streets, the tops of the
      trees in Chelsea Hospital were dimly visible. But in Kent's rooms no one
      cared to look out of window. In the first place, it was difficult of
      access, and in the second, the extraordinary appearance of the apartment
      riveted one's attention entirely to things within.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor was neither carpet nor rug. The place of a fender was
      supplied by three large iron tripods, waifs from some dismantled chemical
      laboratory, which, when they were not otherwise engaged as footstools,
      served to support a kettle, a saucepan, and a glue-pot. All around the
      walls, with just one space for the door, ran a broad deal dresser that did
      duty for several tables, and below it, here and there, were cunningly
      contrived cupboards. Above, every inch of wall was covered: one side
      completely with books, the others with pictures, mostly old engravings,
      little masters such as Cranach and Behm, a frame of perfect little
      Aldegravers, a Prince Rupert mezzo, two Woolmers with their exquisite wavy
      lines, Bewicks, and a magnificent modern Jacquemart etching of a Sèvres
      vase. The intermediate spaces were filled up with a heterogeneous
      assortment of curios. The dresser-table was likewise laden with books,
      coin cases, scientific specimens, strange weapons, old axe-heads, Japanese
      sword hilts cunningly carved, newspapers, journals, pamphlets, and papers
      innumerable. There were only two fairly clear spaces around the whole
      extent: one where Kent worked, and another where he took such meals as he
      had in his lodgings. Save for one solitary leather writing-chair, the
      centre of the large room was absolutely empty; but in a corner, on the
      floor, were piled up a set of canvas deck-chairs which Kent brought out
      and opened whenever he had visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the fixtures in the room he had made with his own hands. Manual labour
      was a delight to him. He also cooked his own food and cleaned out the
      room. The latter operation consisted in raking out the ashes from his
      grate and laying the fire afresh. No peace-destroying woman disturbed the
      precincts with broom and duster. When the dust grew so thick that it
      interfered with his breathing and clouded the lens of his microscope he
      went round with an old towel flicking and flapping with great energy, and
      then he watered the floor out of an old bronchitis-kettle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was a happy man. He had convictions, enthusiasms; manifold interests
      in life for his lighter moments, one great absorbing work for his serious
      hours. His slender income sufficed amply for all his wants, and there was
      always a margin over for the purchase of an occasional rare edition or
      print or curio. Whenever his salary was increased that margin was greater.
      His mode of life never changed, for the simple reason that he considered
      it to be the most delightful one possible. Purple, fine linen, and
      sumptuous fare had no charms for him. It was always with much groaning of
      spirit that he put on dress clothes when he went out into the world. He
      cared not for the high places in the synagogues. Provided he had not to
      wait outside the doors, the pit of a theatre was a place as desirable as
      the stalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his friends too he was happy&mdash;a few men different from himself and
      from each other&mdash;and to these he clung loyally. But the conditions of
      his life removed him from feminine influences. Beyond those girls in his
      immediate family circle, whom he called by their Christian names and
      treated with an old-fashioned, brotherly protection, scolding them when
      they did foolish things, such as wearing light shoes in wet weather,
      performing little services for them when they behaved themselves nicely,
      he never troubled his head about womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night when Clytie's curtains caught fire he had been on his way to
      visit a coterie of three bachelor friends who shared a house in South
      Kensington. They were accustomed to his nocturnal appearances, and the
      worse the night and the later it grew the more likely was Kent to present
      himself at the sitting-room door, a dripping, ruddy apparition, his cheeks
      and beard glistening with raindrops. And then he would throw off his
      mackintosh, call for slippers, and join the circle round the fire. The
      thoughts of the dreary tramp home between two and three never seemed to
      dismay him. Cheerlessness of environment in no way affected his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They formed the chief part of his social life, these three friends, tried
      by the changes in fibre, tastes, affinities, that over half a score of
      years effect. There was Fairfax, the doctor, ruddy, full-blooded, magnetic
      with health and vitality, whose brass plate shone huge on the front door,
      inviting confidence; Greene, the solicitor, shrewd, hard-headed, a speaker
      of few words; and Wither, the civil servant, the little gnomelike man,
      full of strange sayings, whimsical, non-moral, a man of boyish, elfin
      beauty, trusted by men, petted by women. Of the three Kent loved Wither
      best. Wither saw deeper into the world's mysteries than he, but his own
      sturdy honest sense had kept the other from many an abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bidding Clytie good-night, Kent stood irresolute on the landing.
      Should he wrap the remains of his waterproof around him, and still go
      whither his truest happiness had hitherto always led him? Considerations
      of the chill, sleeting night and the throbbing pain in his hand went for
      nothing in his decision. The girl who had tended the burn had almost
      besought him not to go out. To disregard her would be an act of
      discourtesy. Thus thought honest Kent as he turned on his heel and slowly
      mounted the stair. But his evening had been spoiled, he told his briarwood
      pipe, with a consoling sense of martyrdom, and the cause thereof was
      feminine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just the silly sort of thing that Agatha would do,&rdquo; he said to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agatha was his sister, whom he pitied intensely for being a woman. He
      thought of Clytie's pictures, the signs of virility in them, and he began
      to pity Clytie too. Yet there was a difference of kind in his sentiments.
      He pitied his sister for being constrained to ambitionless-ness and
      futility; he was sorry for the handicap of sex to Clytie's ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some such attitude of mind towards her he knocked at the studio door
      the following afternoon. It is true that a warning throb of the bourgeois
      in him, that still sometimes mutely guided the Bohemian along certain
      tracks, had made him consider for a vague moment the correctness of
      calling so immediately upon Clytie; but the directness and simplicity of
      his nature disregarded it. It was only natural that Clytie should like to
      know how his burned hand was faring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the girls busily painting, Winifred at the side, with her basket
      of flowers near her, Clytie standing at her easel, in the middle of the
      room, her back to the door, her face turned half round to see who would
      enter in response to her call.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the floor by the fireside sprawled Jack, the model, eating an orange.
      His face was still dirty, his curly hair matted. Winifred had pathetically
      besought Clytie to have him washed. Why should his poor little face be all
      over dirt?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it could not exist without it,&rdquo; Clytie had answered. &ldquo;It was so
      before he was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred had given her one of her appealing looks from swimming brown
      eyes, and Clytie, remorseful, had run impulsively up and caressed and
      kissed her. But she had not washed Jack's face. He scrambled to his feet
      and looked defiantly, like a young animal, at Kent when he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground-glass roof, the white walls scored over with Clytie's
      fantasies, and the bright red curtain at the back behind the stove gave a
      singular setting to the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie's eyes brightened. She threw a cloth over the picture she was
      engaged on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you to come&mdash;and the hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A trifle. It will be quite well in a few days; I thought you would not
      mind my coming to tell you how your doctoring had succeeded. I am keeping
      it in a sling&mdash;so; otherwise I should be always trying to use it. You
      are none the worse, Miss Davenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nerves, shock, headache&mdash;and all that. My mother, I know, would
      have been upset for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie laughed; a gay little laugh. She pierced through the words to the
      simplicity that lay behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never cultivated nerves, Mr. Kent. They sadly interfere with
      practical life. How do you think Miss Marchpane and I would get on with
      this sort of thing&rdquo;&mdash;and she nodded towards Jack&mdash;&ldquo;if we had
      nerves? Winifred, this is Mr. Kent, who put out my fire last night. Miss
      Marchpane and I share the studio together, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You work on very different lines,&rdquo; said Kent after a while, leaning back
      in his chair so as to catch a glimpse of Winifred's tiny canvas. &ldquo;What a
      strange thing temperament is! I suppose neither of you does landscape.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Winifred. Dainty little bits of meadow and stream. I can't; I
      always want to put legs and arms to my trees, and make the branches twist
      and writhe about, like Gustave Doré in the 'Wandering Jew.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You scarcely look like a painter of the weird,&rdquo; said Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think I have not enough strength of imagination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have too much strength of mind,&rdquo; returned Kent judiciously. &ldquo;You
      hanker too much after the real. I can only judge,&rdquo; he hastily added by way
      of explanation, &ldquo;by what I can see of your work around me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will get into difficulties,&rdquo; said Clytie, laughing. &ldquo;One moment you
      accuse me of nerves, and the next of strong-mindedness. Which is right,
      Winnie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be telling too much or too little if I were to say,&rdquo; replied
      Winifred. &ldquo;Mr. Kent will have to judge for himself. We had better show him
      something to go by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned to an exhibition of Clytie's paintings; small stacks of
      canvases were ranged on the floor, along the walls; here and there one
      hanging or standing on a table or on an easel. Clytie stood by in her
      nonchalant, professional way, giving a word or two of necessary
      explanation as Winifred placed them one by one upon an easel for Kent's
      inspection. Painters, sculptors, musicians and actors have a moral
      advantage over poets and novelists, in that they are not ashamed of their
      work. An artist shows you his picture frankly and hopes you will like it;
      if a poet reads you a sonnet, he has an all-devouring dread lest you may
      deem him a prig. And the strange part of it is that you do; whereas you
      think the painter rather a good fellow. A little problem in sociological
      aesthetics.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kent looked at the pictures he lost his sense of Clytie's Agatha-like
      behaviour of the previous evening. He forgot even to pity her. He
      expressed genuine admiration for her work, interspersing his remarks with
      outspoken criticism which Clytie recognised as deeper than that of the
      mere virtuoso. It was qualified, too, by the supreme attribute of simple
      common sense. He judged the pictures on their merits; he judged Clytie as
      a woman of genius, strong mind, out of the ordinary run of women. The
      inner promptings and cravings that had thus found artistic expression it
      was beyond his philosophy to suspect. Nor did Clytie think of enlightening
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like your realism,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is straightforward. There's always a
      great danger of this sort of thing degenerating into morbidness. But if
      you can keep it true, it's healthy; it means sober, honest work, and not
      an intermittent fever. I see you work off your superfluous energy on the
      walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I forgot them,&rdquo; cried Clytie somewhat shamefacedly. &ldquo;You must not
      look at them, please. They are not part of the show. Miss Marchpane gets
      tired of flowers and peach-bloom, and sometimes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie!&rdquo; cried Winifred reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie laughed; and Kent with her. The light jest brought them nearer
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I do that when I feel wicked,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;I paint a nice, correct
      little picture for the nice, correct people who are going to buy it, and
      then I grow angry with them and feel I should like to shock them, take the
      stiffening out of them, reduce them to elemental bits of humanity. Look at
      this group of street urchins. I am doing that on order for my dealer. Here
      is Jack&mdash;look at him now staring into the stove with the unreasoning
      content of a young dog. Doesn't he seem nice and conventional in the
      picture? You can hear the young lady of the house saying to the curate,
      'Aren't these little street children too delightful?' Now if they were
      shown the real Jack, it would give them to think, as the French say&mdash;and
      they hate doing that. This is <i>my</i> idea of the real Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She whisked the cloth off the easel and showed Kent the charcoal <i>ébauche</i>
      of her own particular study of the urchin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had worked rapidly that day, with the feverishness that Kent
      deprecated. Whether she would convert the sketch into a finished picture
      she did not know. She had desired to fix the haunting impression of Jack's
      possible history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was somewhat startled by the suddenness of the presentation. There
      was the boy, refined, delicate in feature, great-eyed, curly-haired, but
      repulsive with cruelty and animalism; in a degraded attitude, head bent
      forward, knees bent, lips parted in a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does not look like that now,&rdquo; said Kent, comparing the original with
      the copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Clytie. Then imperiously to the urchin: &ldquo;Jack, what are you
      thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, looked up at her shiftingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren't you thinking of the nice little story of the cat you told me this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about a stray cat that came into his mother's house half dead, you
      know, and this boy was so kind to it&mdash;like a dear little girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer lie!&rdquo; cried the boy, starting to his feet. &ldquo;Oi told yer Oi killed
      'er. I lammed her bloomin' 'ed open with a chopper. I 'ates cats!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Voilà!</i>&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;That's the real Jack. That's the Jack I'd
      like to startle Peckham Rye with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then turning to the boy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do for to-day, Jack. Here's your shilling; give it to your
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan't,&rdquo; said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you must,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;look how hard your poor mother has to
      work to keep you, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's bloomin' well got ter,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I aint going to give 'er no
      money. She never gives me none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your mother will beat you,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot do I care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your father, you sweet boy?&rdquo; asked Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aint got none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never had one?&rdquo; continued Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; mother aint that sort. Blamed glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you'd better run away,&rdquo; said Clytie hurriedly. &ldquo;Keep your shilling
      and make yourself as ill as you like with it. Come the day after to-morrow&mdash;Friday.
      Can you remember? It's unnecessary to request you not to wash between then
      and now. Go on. Good-bye. Out you get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy took up the remains of his cap and went, with an air of relief,
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a little brute!&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;Why don't you try to reform him&mdash;make
      him human?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is human,&rdquo; cried Clytie with some warmth. &ldquo;That's why I cultivate him.
      Delightfully human! Refreshing! As for reforming him&rdquo;&mdash;with a shrug
      of her shoulders&mdash;&ldquo;I am not a Sunday-school teacher. I have nothing
      to do with the submerged tenth; let the good respectable folks who have
      submerged them raise them with their polite and respectable hands. I am an
      artist&mdash;a student of life&mdash;what you will. Each one to his trade.
      Perhaps when I have got what I want out of Jack it may amuse me to show
      him the desirability of not 'lamming cats' bloomin' 'eds open with a
      chopper.' I don't know&mdash;I'm not altogether devoid of moral sense.
      Winifred's tender heart may be touched, and between the two of us we may
      turn him out a mild-eyed journeyman carpenter, a member of the Y. M. C.
      A., a model of all the virtues. But I very much doubt it. He has vice in
      his blood. But perhaps I am wounding some of your susceptibilities, Mr.
      Kent? You may be a social reformer, and keener than I on these matters. If
      so, pardon me. We artists are privileged, you know, to view life from our
      own standpoint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent threw up his hand and dropped it&mdash;a little gesture of
      deprecation. He, too, had large views on humanity and its needs. He was
      even then sacrificing comfort, fame, ease, such as other men understand
      them, so as to serve it. But it was according to his own capabilities. It
      was a darling scientific work, that on the most modest computation would
      take him twenty years to complete&mdash;an unthankful task; his name to be
      remembered with reverential gratitude by some half dozen workers, to
      perish unheard of by the remaining millions of mankind. But these half
      dozen would use the result of his life's energies to the advancement of
      human prosperity, and that thought glowed within Kent's heart. Still a man
      has not time for all things. He honestly disclaimed pretensions to being a
      social reformer. He was also artistically sympathetic enough to appreciate
      Clytie's attitude as regards Jack. He was nearer to her in spirit than
      Winifred, who was pained at Clytie's speech. She would have cried out with
      the sharpness of the pain had it not been for Kent's presence. And she
      would have been revolted at the cynical callousness had it not been for
      the blind adoration with which she bowed before Clytie. Whatever Clytie did
      was right, she told herself, and she was a poor little body who could not
      understand these things. But her heart bled for Jack, and she wondered why
      Clytie's did not bleed also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke idly,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;I am sorry. If all artists set about reforming
      their models, their hands would be too full for art. But he is a little
      brute all the same, and, as you say, Peckham Rye would be startled by him.
      But why do you want to shock Philistia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would <i>you</i> like to live in it, be of it, and worship at comfortably
      timed intervals in its correctly appointed temple of Dagon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; laughed Kent. &ldquo;They wouldn't have me in it. I think they could stand
      less of me than I of them. They are God's creatures after all, you know.
      If you prick them, they bleed&mdash;and so forth. If they admire your
      little pictures, which I too admire vastly, there must be some saving
      grace in the Philistines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why should I be obliged to paint in their way, and not in my way?
      That is what irritates me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you tried them with your way, as you call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even Winifred could scarcely forbear flashing at Clytie a little smile of
      tender malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; she whispered softly, and the two broke into
      unconstrained laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winifred is quoting, Mr. Kent. It was an elderly gentleman, stout,
      florid, lots of watch-chain&mdash;one of my patrons. He had bought one of
      my pictures at the dealer's, and came for another. Burrowes showed him one
      of my own own things. Winifred and I happened to be at the back of the
      shop at the time. The old gentleman put on his spectacles, looked at the
      picture, gave such a jump, held it in the light, and then gasped out: 'God
      bless my soul, Burrowes, has the young woman taken to drink?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what I should have done if Winnie had not held me back.&rdquo; As
      it was, Burrowes whispered to him that the artist was overhearing the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, it will do her good,' says the old gentleman, and he went out
      storming. Then Burrowes came to me and complained that I had lost him a
      customer. He has the soul of a pork-butcher, that man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then turning to Kent, her cheeks still flushed with anecdotal animation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's how it is, you see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Kent, &ldquo;perhaps you have reason to owe Philistia a grudge. I
      haven't. If it shuts its respectable doors on me, I shrug my shoulders and
      set up my wigwam outside, where I can smoke my pipe in peace. It is better
      not to care for the world&mdash;or anything, for that matter, if one has
      work to do. One's keenness on life ought to leave one no time for hating
      one's fellow-creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred looked at Clytie, expecting to see her resent the implied rebuke.
      But Clytie only laughed softly to herself, leaning back in her chair,
      looking at her finger tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are by way of being a tonic, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; she said, without looking at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was disconcerted, could not find a reply. He stroked his tawny beard
      and moustache with his free hand, and looked at her somewhat puzzled. He
      had uttered his own robust faith, and she had seized a personal reference
      with which she appeared not displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to imply that you are cynical, Miss Davenant. But you are a
      little vindictive. I, too, often think of that passage in 'Sartor
      Resartus' where Carlyle strips the clothes off the courtiers at St.
      James's and leaves them bare, with their bowings and scrapings&mdash;do
      you remember? Well, it would be a very good thing for them. You would come
      down to pure humanity and find it really a very lovable, great-hearted
      thing after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, for goodness' sake, let us begin to strip the clothes off them at
      once!&rdquo; cried Clytie, changing her attitude, with her usual suddenness.
      &ldquo;That's what I want to do. I want real men, real women; that's why I take
      human nature in the rough&rdquo;&mdash;making a comprehensive sweep with her
      hand round the studio&mdash;&ldquo;The clothes these things wear don't matter;
      you can see the passions working through the rents and tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Umph!&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;You may see something that will frighten you one of
      these days. There's plenty of good in humanity, but there's plenty of bad.
      You had better get hold of what is good first. It will give you a
      foundation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards Kent took his leave. He had paid a longer visit than he
      had anticipated. He found himself pitying Clytie again upon new, less
      definable grounds. He was much struck by her work, her frankness, her
      independence. She was a novelty to him, different from the few other women
      he knew. She seemed to have everything calculated to make a woman happy
      and her life full, and yet he was sorry for her. Why, he could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to his attics, and prepared to spend his usual working evening.
      Afterwards, towards half-past eleven, he might walk across to South
      Kensington. He took from one of the cupboards beneath the dresser-table
      plates, knife and fork, a half-finished tin of sardines, bread and butter.
      This, together with a bottle of beer, formed his frugal evening meal. His
      midday dinner he took at an Italian restaurant near the Museum. He ate
      standing, walking about his room between the mouthfuls, selecting the
      books he would require for his work, and pausing now and then over an idly
      opened volume. His meal finished, he collected the soiled utensils and
      stacked them on the landing outside his door for Mrs. Gurkins to remove,
      wash, and return to the same place in the morning. Then he lit his pipe,
      and settled down to his long evening's work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoughts of burned hand, new-found friends, occupied him not. The crisp
      whisk of the leaves of his reference-books, the rapid whirr of his quill
      pen, the occasional bubble of his green-shaded reading-lamp, were the only
      signs of external life of which he was conscious. The rest of the
      bare-floored room, with its oddly covered walls, was deep in shadow. But
      the light shone in a circle upon the pile of books and papers on which he
      was engaged, and lit up strongly his honest, resolute face, with its
      intent gray eyes and its kindly mouth half hidden in the moustache and
      beard. Kent was happy. The darling work, that served him as mistress,
      religion, ambition&mdash;over which he had never known a heartache&mdash;held
      him in its enchantment. And the wet slips grew in number around him.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>ou are going to
      spend a dismal evening, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting on either side of the drawing-room fire, awaiting dinner
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the crowd that's coming&mdash;fossilised London, with figures like
      amphoras and faces like old coins. It's the principle of assimilation, I
      suppose. And they'll talk as if there were nothing new under the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't there? Wait till you have lived a little longer. At any rate there
      are murders and divorces and new pictures and the latter end of the
      nineteenth century. Why people choose to live a couple of thousand years
      before their time I can't make out. You'll see. They'll all look as if
      they had been excavated&mdash;except George, and he looks as if they had
      never taken the trouble to bury him. Thank goodness, they have all got
      weak digestions and don't dine out much, or else we should have them here
      every week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the wives are coming too,&rdquo; said Clytie by way of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor things! They all look weary with many proof-sheets crammed with
      circumflexes over impossible letters, and wrong-headed pictures of birds
      and beasts. All archaeologists are not like George, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then no one is like George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a mercy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson settling herself with much comfort
      among the cushions of her chair. &ldquo;Don't you get married, my dear; stay
      independent. Do you know, one of the beings is going to read a paper. Pity
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if I am to be pitied too,&rdquo; remarked Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! but you are young and can make fun out of them. I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was a meeting of Mr. Farquharson's archaeological set. The
      inner circle dined at each other's houses in turn once a month, and the
      outer circle came in later, for the &ldquo;conversazione,&rdquo; as Mrs. Farquharson
      called it, with a little shudder. A paper was usually read, followed by a
      discussion, from which the more flippant seceded and gossipped casually in
      odd corners. Clytie had never been to one of these strangely homogeneous
      reunions. The people she generally met at her friends' house were
      miscellaneous, and the talk danced about upon all subjects under heaven,
      wreathed in blue curls of cigarette smoke. Mrs. Farquharson had begged her
      to come and support her&mdash;&ldquo;to strike a note of colour among the gray
      ruins.&rdquo; Clytie looked forward to the incongruous formalism of the evening
      with an anticipation of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hinted as much to Mr. Farquharson when he came into the drawing-room.
      He laughed, bowed his long, ungainly figure, hoped that Miss Davenant had
      come to be instructed. Professor Petherick was to read a paper on an
      aureus of Geta of the type Cohen No. 11,&mdash;Clytie and her hostess
      communed with each other dumbly,&mdash;and many rare coins were to be
      exhibited. He trusted that Miss Davenant would be appreciative and on her
      best behaviour. Numismatics was not a subject that lent itself to
      flippancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife can turn the house into a bear-garden every Sunday evening, more
      shame to her, though she does sit and smile in her superior way. But twice
      a year I assert my individuality and this house becomes sober and
      respectable. So no cigarettes to-night, Miss Davenant. When I put on these
      dress-clothes I am rigid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look very nice,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at himself complacently, accepting the flattery; such is
      man. He always insisted upon wearing very square-toed kid boots, a high
      buttoned waistcoat with a chain made of old coins banded across it, a deep
      velvet collar to his dress-coat, and a shirt-collar, with two long ends
      that served as a tie, beneath his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like him better in his velvet jacket,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson. &ldquo;Go and
      put it on, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But George shook his head sadly. He must be properly attired to discuss an
      aureus of Geta.
    </p>

      The guests arrived, seven in number, and they went down to the
      dining-room. Clytie sat between Professor Petherick, a little rosy man
      with a bald head and gastronomic appreciation, and a young clergyman who
      had taken her in to dinner. She had been for so long a time outside Church
      influences that a strange little Durdleham qualm come over her. He looked
      stern, overworked, dreadfully in earnest, she thought, not likely to
      sympathise with the Thelemite joyousness of life of the house whose motto
      was, &ldquo;<i>Fays ce que vouldras</i>.&rdquo; He was the only bachelor among the
      guests. The six others, including the professor, consisted of three
      married couples, middle-aged, respectable. Mr. Vansittart was a great
      Egyptologist. It was of his wife, a faded, weary-looking woman, that Mrs.
      Farquharson had so pathetically spoken with reference to the correction of
      proof-sheets. Mrs. Petherick was literary, fond of lions. Her talk was a
      catalogue raisonné of her menagerie. Mr. Farquharson listened politely and
      went on with his dinner. The remaining couple were the Chowders, retired
      Anglo-Indians, who found only late in life an opportunity of gratifying
      their ruling passions&mdash;on her part an undisturbed warm bath of
      domesticity; on his, archaeological dilettanteism. She was florid and
      buxom; he bronzed and shrivelled. Both talked on their pet subjects. The
      Rev. Victor Treherne was a keen numismatist. &ldquo;A recognised authority,&rdquo;
       Farquharson had whispered to Clytie. &ldquo;Will give Petherick beans if he goes
      wrong.&rdquo; Clytie knew nothing of numismatics. She did not know the
      difference between a moidur and a bezant, nor did she seek enlightenment
      from her neighbour. She questioned him as to his environment&mdash;North
      London, a large parish, chiefly poor. The conversation languished, then it
      brightened up through common effort. Each had a King Charles the First's
      head to keep in the background, feeling it to be distasteful to the other.
      Treherne had left his parish behind, and had brought no other interests
      with him save those circling round the famous aureus, a matter of supreme
      indifference to Clytie, who, for her part, had been cautioned to act as the
      superior Ki-Pi-Yu, friend of Confucius, did on certain occasions&mdash;roll
      her principles up and keep them in her breast. Each, too, divined dimly
      the other's personality, and they talked eagerly, seeking to like and
      interest one another through a current of mutual antipathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The professor and Mrs. Farquharson were talking less unreservedly on the
      question of female disabilities. He had theories on the sacredness of
      woman's mission. Mrs. Farquharson's views were more materialistic. Her
      early training had disabused her of the oak and ivy illusion, which the
      professor still entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's no use, professor,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A man has got to go his way and a
      woman hers. If their ways lie together, so much the better&mdash;they can
      help each other; if they lie apart, so much the worse. Besides, I cannot
      conceive anything more irritating to a man than to be followed all about
      by his wife&mdash;like a dog. No wonder some men beat their wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Treherne had caught the speech. He turned to Clytie. &ldquo;Do you believe
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Mrs. Farquharson and I are sworn sisters. We hold advanced
      views concerning ourselves. I hope you don't think we have a mission! Have
      you ever thought how distressing it is to try to live up to a false ideal,
      and somebody else's into the bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We all have to live up to an ideal. This one may be false; I don't know.
      At any rate it is a high one, and worth aiming at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Jesuitical. What is to become of a woman's self-respect when she
      knows all the time she is a humbug, although a sublime one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By seeking to inspire others with faith in her she will at length acquire
      faith in herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think that's rather vicious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. The same principle obtains in my own calling. Many a man
      enters the Church who is not really fit for it. But the professional
      effort he has to make to raise others in most cases raises himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be quite true,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;but it does not prove the
      principle to be right. Besides, the cases are different. You undertake,
      when you enter the Church, to do certain things. Now when a woman enters
      the world she does not undertake to do anything, any more than a man does.
      They both clamour to assert themselves as human beings. They may go about
      it in different ways,&mdash;it is merely the difference of sex,&mdash;but
      their ultimate end is the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To get as much out of life as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's scarcely orthodox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The accompanying smile was a touch of the curb on Clytie. She paused.
      There was an interval of dining. Then she turned to reply to a remark of
      the professor. Mrs. Farquharson, who hitherto had steered skilfully
      through the shoals of antiquity, was run aground by Colonel Chowder.
      Clytie was astonished to hear her friend talking learnedly of coins and
      Latin inscriptions. She ran discursively over the points of George's
      collection, toning her speech with a light counterpoint of mockery, so
      that its echo should reach Clytie's ears. Mrs. Chowder bubbled domesticity
      over the Egyptologist; spoke of her sons, the difficulty of army
      examinations. She was bent upon their getting into the service, also upon
      their marrying young. The reconciliation of these incongruities was the
      problem offered for Mr. Vansittart's solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie again turned to Mr. Treherne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you often come here? I am almost of the house and I have never met
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once before, on a similar occasion&mdash;almost the same circle. A common
      hobby brings the most divergent people together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a pity you and I have not got one,&rdquo; said Clytie, flashing a
      malicious glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps we have. What do you mostly do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paint&mdash;for my living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An artist! What is your line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything human&mdash;they call it <i>genre</i>&mdash;street life&mdash;the
      very poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The poor? Then we have a common hobby after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Clytie. &ldquo;But I am afraid we ride it in opposite
      directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know much of their lives&mdash;go among them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much; I see them only externally, from an artist's point of view. I
      should like to see deeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light burned for a moment in the young clergyman's gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you care for work among them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a student, perhaps; as a reformer, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One generally leads to the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I'll not run the risk,&rdquo; she replied laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the drawing-room was filled with the evening guests, mostly
      men. Women archaeologists are scarce. The sentiment with which they inwrap
      relics of the past harms the pure scientific spirit of inquiry. Thus Mr.
      Farquharson to Clytie, briefly explanative. She laughed, reminded him how
      lately in a sentimental mood he had accused women of lack of imagination;
      she reproached him for inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inconsistency is a principle of the art of living,&rdquo; he replied
      epigrammatically, moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men stood in groups about the room chatting on personalities,
      examining the display of coin-cases arranged here and there upon the
      tables, each under the soothing light of a shaded lamp. The professor
      stood by himself on the hearthrug, hemming irritably, anxious to read his
      paper. The talk was subdued, attitudes formal, a contrast to the ordinary
      easy abandonment of that drawing-room. The men were of a different type,
      mostly elderly, sedate. Mrs. Farquharson rested for a moment from her
      exertions as hostess by Clytie's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for a minute's peace. I wish the men would smoke, they all look so
      woebegone; but George says they mustn't. Now, then, my dear, I haven't
      seen you for ages, except for those five minutes before dinner; what have
      you been doing lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much&mdash;working. Oh! yes, I have, though. I have found a new
      chum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a she, it's a he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he come from?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Farquharson, arching her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the skies, apparently: in the first case to put out a fire in my
      room&mdash;he lives over me in the attics&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie! You must be careful. Who is he? What's his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline,&rdquo; said her husband's deep voice behind her chair, &ldquo;I don't think
      you know Mr. Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie started round violently at the shock of the coincidence. Kent was
      standing by her side, looking odd, changed, a bit Philistine in his
      evening dress. He wore a glove over his burned hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked, explained their meeting. He had had a numismatic acquaintance
      with Mr. Farquharson for a long time past. Had received his invitation at
      the Museum, his private address not being known to his host. Clytie
      described her own privileged position in the household, speaking frankly,
      vivaciously. She felt a little thrill of pleasure at seeing him there. He
      seemed, more than the other guests, in harmony with the traditions of the
      house. They had not time for much conversation, social exigencies
      separating them. Besides, a general buzz and a subsiding into chairs or
      restful attitudes sounded the warning that Professor Petherick was about
      to read his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He described the coin that had come into his possession,&mdash;previously
      it had been passed round for the inspection of the guests,&mdash;claiming
      it to be a finer specimen than the one in the Caylus collection. The
      figure of Castor beside his horse, without the pileus, on the reverse, he
      argued was a portrait of the unfortunate young co-emperor. The legend on
      the obverse proclaimed that it was a coin of Geta. He took this as the
      text for a learned disquisition upon the aureus, tracing its origin, the
      variations in its weight, to the time of Justinian, who fixed it as a
      limit stake for a throw of the dice. He quoted Pitiscus, Eckhel, many
      learned authorities. He read in a bland, easy tone, confident of his facts
      and his deductions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie felt relieved when he had finished. Across the room she had now and
      then caught Kent's eye, which had a humourous twinkle in it. She, who an
      hour before had been scoffing at the dry-as-dust nature of numismatics as
      a pursuit, now felt a consciousness of inferiority, of being relegated to
      the tribe feminine, who are not expected to care for intellectual matters.
      She nourished a seed of resentment against Kent and all archaeologists.
      But when the usual discussion on the paper began she set an example of
      interest in it to Mr. Vansittart, who had come over and sat down by her
      side. Really, she was curious to see what part Kent would take in the
      discussion. He seemed to find many acquaintances in the room, and an
      appreciative welcome from each. She experienced a strange sense of
      satisfaction at the dispelling of an unformulated apprehension lest he
      might be unknown, insignificant. She had seen him several times since his
      visit to the studio; once they had met at Sloane Square station and had
      walked home together. The acquaintance was ripening into friendliness. Now
      she was interested at seeing him in a new environment. Our conception of
      people changes very much according to the conditions with which we
      associate them. But Kent in the drawing-room, despite his unfamiliar
      attire, seemed much the same as Kent in the studio, his manner towards the
      men she saw him talking with much the same as his manner towards her.
      Presently he rose, broke into the discussion. The principal participators
      listened with apparent respect to his remarks, few in number, but apt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Kent is an authority,&rdquo; said the professor, surrendering a
      particular point with a certain grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little tribute fell gratefully on Clytie's ears. Suddenly she became
      conscious that her pleasure was greater than the occasion warranted. She
      turned round quickly to Mr. Vansittart, who was taking but mild interest
      in the affair, and somewhat abruptly opened a conversation. The Rev. Mr.
      Treherne joined them soon afterwards, asking permission to introduce a
      friend. Thus it came about that Clytie had a small group around her, and
      her interest in Kent's proceedings was checked for a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Farquharson had threaded her way through the crowd of black
      coats, and taken Kent off with her to an undisturbed corner. She was
      curious to examine Clytie's new &ldquo;chum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you live in the same house as Clytie Davenant. You rescued her from
      the flames, didn't you? She told me something about it. What happened,
      exactly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent sketched briefly the little scene with the blazing curtains, and
      mentioned his visit next day and his subsequent meetings with Clytie. He
      politely expressed his agreeable surprise at meeting her to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you think of her?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Farquharson confidentially. &ldquo;I
      dare say it's an odd question, but if you will come and see us again, you
      will find we are given to saying odd things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Miss Davenant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found that out already? Well, come, what do you think of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly, or conventionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I meant conventionally, I should not ask you the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent waited for a moment, stroking his beard. He was scarcely prepared
      with an answer even to satisfy himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. She is a bit too complicated to be defined in a phrase like
      a term in Euclid. She is nearer to a man than any woman I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson smiled inwardly, noting the phrase, yet liking him for
      it. It was so deliciously wrong, so absurdly off the track. She
      contemplated him from the empyrean of feminine wisdom, and from that
      moment took him under her protection. To blunder honestly in things
      feminine is one of the ways to a woman's pity, thence often to her heart.
      She encouraged him, however, instead of correcting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one reason, because I can talk to her as I would to a man. She has
      ideas and is not afraid of expressing them. In fact, she is different from
      the ordinary women one meets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! she is that,&rdquo; Mrs. Farquharson granted. &ldquo;She is all for <i>le
      nouveau jeu</i>. When I want to tease her I tell her she will find it <i>le
      vieux jeu</i> all the time, but she won't believe it.&rdquo; Then suddenly,
      &ldquo;Don't you think she is very pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty?&rdquo; echoed Kent in some confusion. &ldquo;Really, yes, I suppose she is. I
      hardly thought about it,&rdquo; and leaning his body aside, so as to catch a
      distant glimpse of Clytie between the forms of the little circle of men
      round her, he added, &ldquo;she is very pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And truly it was a fair picture that his eye fell upon. She was wearing a
      simple dress of ivory-coloured silk, falling in soft, straight folds to
      her feet. Her low-cut bodice was relieved only by a ruffle of old lace
      along the top, and the sole ornament she wore, a necklet of antique
      silver, brought out the delicate modelling of her shapely neck, as she sat
      talking animatedly, her chin pointing upwards. Her rich, vivid colouring
      compensated for any lack of relief in her costume. The intense blue of her
      eyes, the many glints in her auburn hair, twisted in a careless knot at
      the back of her small, shapely head, and kept in place by a broad silver
      arrow, would of themselves have supplied the place of any ornament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very pretty indeed&mdash;striking!&rdquo; repeated Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson looked at him amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be an original, Mr. Kent. Fancy knowing Clytie Davenant without
      thinking of her looks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a great bear,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;My sister says so, and brothers and
      sisters generally speak the truth to each other. Of course I have thought
      of Miss Davenant's looks, in a way&mdash;admired her artistically; but I
      have never realised in her society that I have been talking to a pretty
      girl&mdash;one consciously so. She does not seem to expect you to be
      impressed with her looks. That's one thing that I like about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson carried on the conversation a little further and then
      directed it into other channels. She was pleased with Kent, and made a
      mental note to see more of him. A man who could like Clytie and yet not
      reflect upon her personal attractiveness was, as she had said, an oddity,
      and Mrs. Farquharson made oddities rather a speciality.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was growing late and there was a perceptible thinning in the numbers of
      the guests. A few enthusiasts lingered fondly over the showcases,
      comparing their contents with specimens in their own or other collections.
      Among these was Treherne, by himself, deeply cogitative. He arrested Kent,
      who was passing by to speak to Clytie, whom he had scarcely seen during
      the evening, as he had felt bound to take an honest and practical interest
      in the proceedings. The question that Treherne desired Kent's help in
      solving was a knotty one, and the two men bent over the table absorbed in
      deciphering an obliterated obverse. When the matter was settled Kent
      looked around for Clytie, but she had already disappeared. There was
      nothing left for him to do but to take his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you care for a Bohemian Sunday evening scramble, when everyone talks
      inconsequent nonsense&mdash;quite a different thing from to-night,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Farquharson, shaking hands&mdash;&ldquo;we shall be very glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the hall he was pleased to see Clytie, fur cloaked, waiting for a cab.
      She gave him a frank smile of recognition. With his white slouch hat and
      waterproof&mdash;a new one&mdash;his figure seemed to her very familiar.
      He talked to her for a moment or two, until the cab was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you going home?&rdquo; she said when they were on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walk,&rdquo; he replied briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's raining hard&mdash;would you accept a lift?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the swing doors for her, shielding her dress from the muddy
      wheels as she entered, and then hesitated a moment. He had in fact been
      intending to pay one of his midnight visits to his South Kensington
      friends, but Clytie thought his hesitation was due to considerations of
      propriety. She laughed with a little thrill of defiance as she settled
      herself comfortably in a corner. The touch of rebelliousness let loose an
      unwonted shaft of coquetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course if you think it would do you more good to walk in the rain than
      drive dry with me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The interval between her two remarks had been very short, taken up
      entirely with the process of Clytie's seating herself in the cab, but
      still Kent felt he had been somewhat unchivalrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really don't mind, I shall be very grateful,&rdquo; he said by way of
      making amends as he took his seat by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, driving with Clytie was not unpleasant, he reflected, and he
      could see Wither and Fairfax any day. That Clytie should have made her
      offer did not seem unnatural. He frankly informed her of the cause of his
      hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I paid you the compliment of being mistaken,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, catching a glimpse of her face in the swift
      gleam of a gas-lamp. She was smiling, in good humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! if you are mystified, so much the better,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;It will be
      my little revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was all the explanation she vouchsafed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, that drive spun a thread of intimacy between them. There are few
      conditions of companionship so favourable as those in a hansom cab. The
      driver is practically non-existent; the three sides and roof of the
      vehicle form a temporary home, a <i>chez soi</i>. The outside world lies
      in front of one, very near, and yet one is out of it. Even the desolate
      squares, with their occasional lamps blinking through the mist, and their
      wet, sooty trees rustling reluctantly as the wind passes through them, and
      their gaunt houses, each grimly and jealously guarding its household,
      giving the sense of the awful isolation of souls, fail to depress as they
      invariably depress the sensitive pedestrian. There is again the cheerful
      rattle which precludes sustained conversation, but encourages disjointed,
      intimate talk. The rush of the air, the whirling past of figures and
      objects, is exhilarating even in the vilest of weather and in the
      dreariest of neighbourhoods. The rapid night glimpses, too, of
      coffee-stalls, their lamps glaring upon the surrounding idlers; public
      houses, with the sudden babel of voices issuing from an opened door;
      walkers of the pavement forlornly standing with white, indistinguishable
      faces, 'buses steaming and labouring with their somnolent fares; every
      'bus-load the counterpart of the last; swifter still, the glimpses of the
      occupants of other cabs that pass, stimulating the imagination; a
      phantasmagoria of life, almost unreal, yet bringing into play some of the
      lighter elemental forces of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie was almost sorry when the cab stopped at the familiar side-door
      next to the shop where the legend of &ldquo;Gurkins, green-grocer,&rdquo; was dimly
      visible through the gloom. Much of the mere woman in her had risen to the
      surface, obscuring the artist, the hater of formulas, the restless seeker
      after the mysteries of life. She had felt childish, frivolous, thus
      appearing in a new light to Kent, not without a certain charm, although he
      wondered to himself whether she, after all, was not like the rest of
      womankind&mdash;&ldquo;fundamentally silly.&rdquo; This was a famous dictum of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the door closed behind them, and the narrow, ill-lighted,
      close-smelling passage leading to the gloomy staircase struck upon her
      senses, the realities of life came sharply before her, and her usual
      independence of thought and action reasserted itself. Otherwise, when she
      had said good-night to Kent on the landing and had found her room in
      darkness, she would not have called him back to light her lamp for her,
      and, that done, have asked him to remain for a short chat. He was struck
      by the change to her usual frank tones, and seeking half unconsciously for
      a reason, attributed his late impression to an illusion on his part caused
      by the darkness and dispelled by the light, by which he could see her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You smoke, I know,&rdquo; she said, throwing her wraps on to the sofa. &ldquo;You
      must be dying for some tobacco. What do you smoke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a pipe,&rdquo; he replied with much fervour, instantly seeking for it in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie turned to poke the fire. It was black and sulky, and her efforts
      were of not much avail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me try,&rdquo; said Kent, bending down with her on the hearthrug; &ldquo;this is
      a thing not generally known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw a lighted match on to the fire, the escaping gases burst into
      flame, and cheerfulness was established in the grate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trivial incident, but it was recognised by them both in after years as
      having served to cement their comradeship.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he friendship
      between them ripened imperceptibly. Each day brought its tiny thread
      linking them together, so gradually, so subtly, that it was not until long
      afterwards that they realised the immense strength of the bond. At first
      it was mere honest liking on both sides, a pleasant consciousness of
      discovery, an ordinary attraction between two natures, distinct, yet more
      or less complementary. Clytie found it written in her Book of New Formulas
      that the loyal friendship between a man and a woman was a strengthening
      element of existence. In her fierce pride and young vigour she would not
      allow that each supplied what the other lacked, according to the popular
      theory&mdash;the man strength, the woman grace&mdash;but asserted
      strenuously the truth that each could lend the other elements of strength
      the same in degree, but different in kind, owing to the difference of sex.
      If it had been suggested to her that her weaker woman's nature
      instinctively, in spite of perfect emancipation and proud independence,
      sought the man's protecting fibre, the whole amazon within her would have
      been up in arms. She found in Kent a man whom she could meet upon a ground
      of perfect equality&mdash;perfectly even, neither blocked by prejudices
      and social barriers nor haunted by sexual spectres. She was woman enough,
      however, to perceive intuitively certain shynesses in Kent, resulting from
      a half knowledge of her, that would have kept him aloof in spite of a very
      sensible attraction towards her; and in showing him, therefore, that this
      attraction was mutual she felt no compunction,&mdash;rather pride, on the
      contrary, in reaching a superior plane in which conduct was measured by
      superior standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it came about that the eternal feminine once more deceived
      itself, mistaking nature for what it called the Fine Art of Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, for his part, did not attempt to realise the charm that made his
      fingers close daily on the handle of the studio door. He accepted the
      offered friendship, and returned it as frankly as it was given. It became
      as natural to stop at the studio, before mounting to his attics on his
      return home from the Museum, as to burst into the South Kensington
      &ldquo;monastery&rdquo; for a midnight rubber. Variety, fresh interests, were brought
      into his life, vivid as it was with darling hopes and full working
      energies. It was refreshing to come once again into the sphere, familiar
      and dear to him during his father's lifetime, of practical art. It was
      something for him to look forward to, during his tramp home&mdash;the
      stage nearer completeness effected during a day's work in an artistic
      creation. Gradually, in his blunt, paternal way, he constituted himself
      the censor of Clytie's work, criticising irregularities, suggesting
      treatment. There grew within him, too, a brotherly kindness towards
      Winifred, who looked forward also to his afternoon visit, when she would
      shyly uncover the small canvas and receive with a gratified flush his meed
      of appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arrived after the tea-things had been cleared away, when the day's work
      was over, in the twilight hour, outstaying Winifred a short while, whose
      evening family meal was half an hour before Clytie's dinner. It was in
      these short periods of companionship, when they were alone together, that,
      unconsciously to themselves, the finer touches were added to the broader
      intimacy that the previous half hour had brought one step further in
      development. Piece by piece, by means of a reference here, a petulant
      outburst there, he grew familiar with the ambitions and struggles of her
      past life. He was quick to catch a certain note of disappointment. She had
      not yet become a great artist, was defiantly certain that she could never
      be one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you won't if you use your art as a stepping-stone to life,&rdquo; he
      said one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She marked the saying, resolving, however, half rebelliously to make him
      belie his words in the days to come. She, too, gathered from him the
      nature of his hope and aspirations, wondered at the cheerful selflessness
      with which he contemplated the work that would bring him neither name nor
      fame, nor the things that many men desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he took Clytie and Winifred up to his attic museum, pleased as a
      boy to show them his treasures. Winifred praised the bright neatness of
      his arrangements. He confessed guiltily that he had been &ldquo;tidying up&rdquo;&mdash;a
      process that had cost him the whole of the previous Sunday. Many of his
      pictures had been left him by his father, particularly his collection of
      Aldegravers, over which he fondly lingered, lamenting that the old days of
      pure design were over, and railing at the mercenary spirit of modern art.
      He counselled Clytie to study the little masters for her book
      illustrating. She would learn restraint, abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's no good preaching Dürer and Behm in these days,&rdquo; he added
      pathetically, with the resignation of the collector who does not expect
      his hobby to be understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie laughed softly, sympathetic with his enthusiasms. No real artist
      can help loving the little masters. But Clytie's artistic impulses warred
      with each other, with circumstance, and with herself. So she refused to
      sit, for practical purposes, at the foot of Aldegraver. She ran over the
      titles of books, borrowed a couple, which he recommended, from the general
      literature section, stood in some dismay before the scientific
      specialist's library, and asked to see what was visible of the great work.
      He gave her some bundles of manuscript, which she turned over helplessly
      and handed back without a word. They were evidences of a world of infinite
      toil and devotion not yet intelligible to her. She gazed around the
      picturesque walls of the room that contrasted strangely with the
      carpetless floor and the fenderless grate. The absence of the minor
      softnesses of material life struck her vividly. There were evidences of a
      high love for art, but art in a too rarefied atmosphere for her nature.
      She would have liked to curtain the windows,&mdash;they were even
      destitute of blinds,&mdash;to put rugs about the floor, to soften the room
      with drapery, plants, flowers; even an armchair beside the fire would have
      been aesthetically as well as physically reposeful. Winifred's simpler
      feminine impulses struck the true chord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why doesn't your sister make you some pretty things for your room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does&mdash;heaps of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent looked at her with humorous shamefacedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have a drawer full of them somewhere,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your room is very much like yourself,&rdquo; she said in a low voice, and
      hesitating a little. &ldquo;You both lack the same thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And blundering John Kent misread the oracle, accepting it as a reproach
      for brotherly unkindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Clytie's &ldquo;own&rdquo; picture of the model Jack was developing into a
      more finished and more ambitious work than she had originally intended. On
      Kent's suggestion she had toned down some of its brutality without
      rendering less vivid the presentation of the problem. She thought of
      trying to exhibit the picture when it was completed; Jack therefore
      continued to appear in the studio at irregular intervals. Winifred
      encouraged him now, trying to humanise him with picture-books, stories,
      and simple talk, but Clytie shook her head at her gentle friend's efforts,
      conceiving them, with her fuller and more materialistic knowledge, to be
      entirely futile. Still Winifred obtained from him more details of what
      Clytie called his private life than she herself could do. With both of
      them he was fierce and sullen, but with Winifred he was more cynically
      expansive. These details only supplemented the data afforded by his own
      personality. Sometimes he went to the board school, where he was in the
      third standard; oftener he stayed away. He slept in his mother's room, ate
      his desultory food there with the fierceness of a young wolf; but his real
      home was in the street. Once he had been given a situation as satellite to
      a thriving costermonger, but the restraints of regular employment had
      chafed him into resignation of his post. Besides, his employer had
      thrashed him unmercifully. As for his parentage, he was entirely ignorant;
      he did not care. To his mind it was a merciful dispensation of Providence
      that he only had one parent to irritate and annoy him. He liked to come to
      the studio because it was warm and comfortable, besides which he obtained
      a shilling at the end of the day to be expended on inferior tobacco when
      together with his playmates.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, earlier than usual, he slouched up the stairs and, contrary
      to custom, found the studio door open and the apartment empty. He entered,
      swinging the door with him, which, being caught by the draught from an
      open skylight, slammed with sudden violence. If he had heard the quick
      rattle of a falling door-knob, his subsequent conduct would doubtless have
      been modified. He was alone in the studio; he waited idly, lying in front
      of the stove; but as no one came, he began to feel restless. He rose to
      his feet, wandered about, shut the skylight, examined the contents of the
      studio. He found a packet of cigarettes lying about, which he pocketed; an
      investigation of the cupboard in the wall rewarded him with some lumps of
      sugar and some sweet biscuits. Still no one came, which was not
      extraordinary, as his employer had not yet thought of breakfasting. No
      further resources being offered to his predatory instincts, he proceeded
      to look at the pictures, with which he had already a contemptuous
      familiarity. The only one for which he had a genuine admiration, or rather
      the barbarian's feeling of awe at any counterfeit presentment of himself,
      was his own portrait. At this he seldom tired of looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took down from the wall a little painted mirror, and, sitting on the
      stool in front of the picture, proceeded to compare the original and the
      portrait. He saw that the resemblance was not quite perfect, and like a
      monkey he grimaced into the looking-glass until he had reproduced the
      expression that Clytie had fixed upon the canvas. Then he laughed in great
      glee, scratched his black curly head, and went in quest of further
      occupation. He crossed over to Winifred's easel and took off the cloth. He
      had no great idea of &ldquo;the other one's&rdquo; picture. It did not interest him.
      But, unfortunately, in his simian mood, an idea shot through his mind. Why
      should he not try to paint too?
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted upon Winifred's seat, took her palette in his hand as he had
      seen her hold it, with his small, dirty thumb through the hole in the
      white porcelain, gathered the little sheaf of brushes, arranged the
      mahl-stick imitatively, and, dipping a brush into the remains of some
      Chinese white, tried to fill in some anemones. They were only splotches of
      white paint, but the occupation absorbed him. In a very few moments the
      whole canvas was starred with Jack's white dabs. Then, growing tired of
      the monotony of white,&mdash;the colours on the palette did not attract
      him,&mdash;he fetched Clytie's, which was more richly prepared, and
      painted in strokes of crimson and yellow. The delight of colour fascinated
      him. He obliterated all the white, daubed the canvas over and over with
      heavy streaks, laughing aloud with the spirit of diabolical mischief.
      Then, with a fox terrier's or a monkey's instinct of destruction, he took
      up the palette-knife and stabbed holes through the canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He contemplated his work for a moment, and then, the very human
      anticipation of consequences occurring to his mind, he bethought himself
      of flight. But, to his dismay, he found the door-handle had fallen off
      when the door had slammed, and that he was a prisoner until someone should
      open it from outside. He paused for a moment in the middle of the room,
      reflecting. Then he covered up his handiwork carefully with a cloth,
      scrupulously replaced the palettes and brushes, and curled himself up in
      his usual doglike attitude by the stove, there to await events.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time there came a rattle of the knob-screw being fitted into the
      vacant hole in the lock, which made his heart beat, and Clytie entered the
      room humming a song. She was surprised to find him there, and elicited a
      monosyllabic explanation of his presence. She was in a good humour and
      talked lightly to him as she moved about the studio, changing the water of
      some flowers. The errand-boy from the shop below came up with Winnie's
      anemones that had been put in a cool place over night to keep them fresh
      one day longer. Clytie set them on the stand beside Winifred's easel. Jack
      watched her, looked at the door, measuring the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Clytie asked sharply as she turned round and caught
      him stealing across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was terribly afraid of her. Those great dark blue eyes seemed to
      command him. He never could meet them with his own. He relapsed doggedly
      into his position by the stove. Clytie touched the anemones daintily,
      picking some faded leaves, still humming her song. In lightness of heart
      she took off the cloth to look at Winnie's work, and then fell back with a
      cry of horror and anger. A swift glance at Jack brought her knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little fiend!&rdquo; she cried with eyes aflame, and catching the cowering,
      sullen urchin by the collar of shirt and jacket, she dragged him out of
      the studio, on to the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent happened to have just gone down the stairs on his way out. The noise
      of the scuffle reached him in the entrance passage and brought him up to
      the studio door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; he asked, taking the boy from Clytie's grasp into
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter? Go inside. I must call Winnie. Winnie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the sitting-room door. Winifred ran out, holding her gloves,
      which she had just taken off, in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That boy&mdash;that little devil!&rdquo; cried Clytie, and they both ran into
      the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent had just entered, and was standing before the mutilated picture
      holding the boy, who in Kent's hands was struggling violently. Winifred
      looked at it for a moment blankly, scarcely understanding. Then the
      sickening truth rose to her brain, and she leaned, very white, against the
      wall, looking at the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake take the little brute out and kill him, Mr. Kent!&rdquo; Clytie
      broke out fiercely. &ldquo;Murder him! break every bone in his body! To have
      done such a thing as that! It is not human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll give him a thundering hiding,&rdquo; said Kent wrathfully, dragging him
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Winifred rose quickly, moved her neck, cleared her throat, and laid
      her hand on Kent's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't beat him&mdash;I couldn't bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Winnie! sit down,&rdquo; cried Clytie. &ldquo;Take him away Mr. Kent, or
      I'll do him some mischief myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent shook the urchin till his teeth chattered and his evil little face
      grew red. Winifred still clung to his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't! you shan't do it! He is no better than an animal! He did not know
      what he was doing. Nothing you could do to him would give me back my
      picture. It would be simple vengeance. Oh, send him away! Send him away!&rdquo;
       and turning from Kent, she burst into tears and clung to Clytie, sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Marchpane is right,&rdquo; said Kent slowly and looking at Clytie. &ldquo;Let
      the little brute go. Here, you, go! If ever I see you near the place, I
      will give you to a policeman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Visions of the lowering blue storm-cloud, ever seeming to the children of
      the streets ready to burst upon their heads, loomed before the little
      outcast's imagination. He shivered, shrunk away from Kent's relaxed grasp,
      darted a keen, swift look of malignity at Clytie, and disappeared like a
      flash through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie held Winifred protectingly with one arm, soothing her, mingling
      words of comfort with outbursts of self-reproach and unrighteous
      indignation. As Jack slipped away she made an impulsive movement forward,
      but Winifred restrained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you let him go?&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning her anger upon Kent. &ldquo;If
      it had not been for you I would have given him a lesson he'd have
      remembered all his life. To do a work of devilry like that and not be
      punished! I'll set the police upon him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; murmured Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. What are reformatories for? Go and call a policeman, Mr. Kent. It
      is the least you can do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave him alone,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;It would not do him any good and
      it would not do Miss Marchpane any good. He'll never come here again, and
      I should advise you not to introduce any more of his sort into your
      studio. When a child of the flesh and the devil gets hold of a thing of
      the spirit, the spiritual suffers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish to be lectured,&rdquo; said Clytie stonily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry if I have offended you, Miss Davenant,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;I have
      the sincerest sympathy with Miss Marchpane for her loss, and I would do
      anything in the world to help her or you; and so&mdash;good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent worked hard that day at the Museum. He was troubled over the
      morning's occurrence. He was conscious that he had acted rightly in
      acquiescing in Winifred's counsel of mercy, but he had a vague,
      inarticulate regret that he had not pleased Clytie. He resolutely set
      himself to forget everything in his work and finished earlier than usual.
      On his way out he met his friend Wither in the great hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to carry you off to the club to dine and there to reason with
      you,&rdquo; said the small, gnomelike man. &ldquo;They are spring-cleaning at home and
      the place reeks of freshness and innocence. Greene and Fairfax like it;
      they say it's healthy. I prefer the accumulated and mellowed deposit of
      winter. It's as bad as washing a meerschaum. Anyhow, it's got to get
      coloured a bit, and until it does I clear out and you are coming to clear
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Kent; &ldquo;I will waste part of an evening upon you&mdash;to
      prevent you wasting it yourself more sinfully. You were lucky to catch me;
      I was just going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman at the door saluted Kent as he passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to have been for me,&rdquo; said Wither. &ldquo;I am far the more
      reputable-looking of the two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent laughed good-humouredly and grasped his ash stick sturdily in his
      gloveless hands. The contrast between the dandified elegance of Wither's
      dress and his own careless, loose attire appealed to his sense of the
      humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll walk a few yards behind you if you like,&rdquo; he said, repeating a
      familiar and time-honoured jest between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked down the great flight of steps and across the courtyard, where
      the pigeons were fluttering joyfully in the afternoon sunshine. When they
      had arrived at the railings, whose gilt spear-points caught the sun,
      Wither turned and looked for a moment at the frowning mass of the edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This always suggests the brain of London, immeasurable in this ugly poll
      of a Bloomsbury, with its watery eyes and dejected face, that seems to be
      perpetually meditating on death and influenza. I am going to work up the
      idea one of these days and turn it into copy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly does not look promising in the crude state,&rdquo; observed Kent
      by way of encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked along Oxford Street and down Shaftesbury Avenue. Here, while
      passing in front of a photographer's window, their eyes were caught by a
      group of complacent people of both sexes&mdash;&ldquo;with superior smiles and
      inferior clothes,&rdquo; as Wither said&mdash;described by a legend printed on
      the mount as the &ldquo;Parnassus House Mutual Improvement Society.&rdquo; Wither
      entered the shop and purchased a copy, as a &ldquo;monument of the stupendous
      fatuity of man.&rdquo; In the comfortable smoking-room of the Junior
      Cosmopolitan, St. James's Square, Wither held the photograph out on his
      knees before him and discoursed upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; he said, half hidden in the great armchair. &ldquo;Dear old
      Philistia! When is the Almighty going to redeem his promise and triumph
      over it? Mutual improvement!&mdash;on the principle of Mark Twain's
      islanders, who eked out a precarious livelihood by taking in each other's
      washing! This pathetic kind of person belongs to home reading societies.
      Do you know what they are? I was staying with the Brownes last summer;
      asked the youngest to come and play tennis. She replied with awful
      solemnity that she was going to read her 'half hour.' I was impressed;
      good girl, I said, and pictured her to myself conducting her devotional
      exercises over St. Thomas à Kempis or St. Augustine's 'Confessions' in the
      sanctity of her maiden chamber. Next day I found her reading the report of
      an agricultural commission for the year 1831. Asked her what the deuce she
      was reading that for. She replied she was reading her 'half hour'; it was
      the only 'solid' book she could find downstairs! Novels and poetry and
      magazines were tabooed. I asked her whether she thought George Meredith or
      Dante flippant. She could not exactly say&mdash;but they were not solid.
      God help us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are as bad as my friend Miss Davenant,&rdquo; said Kent, laughing. &ldquo;She is
      always railing at Philistia. You might lend me the photograph to show her;
      it would amuse her&mdash;perhaps it might teach her something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither gave him the photograph, but after a short pause Kent returned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it some other time. I don't quite know at present how we are
      going to stand to one another; we had a bit of a scene this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither raised his eyebrows and turned his head lazily, looking at Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You interest me, friend John. Is Saul also among the prophets? Expound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent roughly sketched the morning's episode in the studio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you see, there's something in the nature of a split,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will come round all right,&rdquo; said Wither, &ldquo;if she cares about you. If
      she doesn't, she is not worth caring about. Never you mind. There is
      nothing does women so much good as a little wholesome neglect. <i>Crede
      experto</i>. As for the matter in question, of course you were wrong. You
      should have thrashed the little devil's life out. But with a woman, having
      right or wrong on her side has nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be true in the case of the woman you like to philander with,
      Teddy, but Clytie Davenant's different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah, my dear old boy, they are all the same, every one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never met one of them whom you could treat in the ordinary
      straightforward way&mdash;make a friend of as if she were a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, old chap, nor do I want to. If you've got to treat a woman as if she
      were a man, what the devil's the good of her being a woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking for the sake of talking, Teddy,&rdquo; said Kent with some
      earnestness. &ldquo;You know it's all nonsense. Women generally are foolish
      enough, God knows, but the sole end of their being is not to be fooled
      about with in flirtations and love-makings and such sickening nonsense.
      And when one does come across a girl with an intelligence above the
      ordinary and instincts above bazaars and the river, one likes her and is
      exceedingly sorry to have any row with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; murmured the little man, examining his trim finger nails with
      intent brow, &ldquo;whether we cultivate the 'languor and lilies of virtue,' or
      the 'roses and raptures of vice,' it doesn't matter&mdash;the trail of the
      petticoat's over us all. Come and have a 'hundred up' before dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent did not carry home the ridiculous portrait, and Wither, to avoid the
      trouble of taking with him the awkwardly sized parcel that would not fit
      into his pocket, very characteristically posted it to himself. As Kent
      passed Clytie's door he noticed that it was ajar and that the room was
      dark. Evidently she had gone out. If she had retired early to bed, she
      would have shut the door, as her bedroom opened into the sitting-room. He
      felt a certain sense of loss, he did not know why, for even if the little
      streak of light beneath the door had announced her presence within, he
      certainly would not have sought admittance. He went upstairs more slowly
      than usual, thinking of her and of the morning's scene. By the dim gas on
      his landing he perceived an unframed picture leaning, face-hidden, against
      his door, and on the ground a letter. This was addressed to him in the
      bold, rounded handwriting which he recognised as Clytie's. He opened it
      and read:
    </p>
    <p>
      You were right. I am sorry. Keep the picture as a token.
    </p>
    <h3>
      C. D.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Kent turned the canvas round. It was the exhibition picture of Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it in with him, and placed it on his dresser-table. It formed a
      strange contrast to the calm-faced Woolmer cavalier that was hanging
      above; a strange contrast, too, with its colour, its modernity, its
      realism, to the cold classicism of the pale, pure relics of the past that
      lined the walls. Troubled by the discord, he turned its face to the wall,
      but immediately, ashamed of the impulse and calling himself a fool, he
      turned it again. Then, after lighting his reading-lamp and turning out the
      gas, he sat down at the writing space on his dresser-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room door was open. The house was perfectly still, save for the
      occasional creak of the stairs and banisters near the attics. From the
      street outside, far beneath, came the faint, ghostlike rumble of passing
      vehicles. Kent had never realised what absolute silence reigned at night
      in that quiet household. A cuckoo-clock in the bedroom below struck with a
      suddenness and clearness that startled him. It was only twelve o'clock.
      Clytie would be back soon if she had gone out to spend the evening with
      friends or at a theatre. He proceeded with some mechanical work, docketing
      papers, his ear expectant of the sudden drag of a hansom at the street
      door. Several times he was deceived and went out on the landing to listen
      for the sounds announcing Clytie's arrival. Then he resumed his
      occupation. Perhaps she was indoors and asleep all the time, he thought;
      but the open door surely betokened her absence. He persuaded himself into
      this belief, desiring intensely to see her. The immediate fulfilment of
      Wither's prognostications troubled him. Had it not been for his friend's
      bantering remarks he would have judged Clytie's frank confession by the
      touchstone of his own simplicity, and found it natural, prompted by no
      other motives than kindliness and common sense. But what if it proceeded
      from the &ldquo;fundamental silliness&rdquo; of woman, that he himself pitied and
      Wither professed to hold in contempt?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last an unmistakable pause in the dimly heard rattle of a hansom made
      him rise again and go on to the landing. Someone entered the house. He
      heard the far distant creak of the stairs and the vague rustle of skirts.
      It was Clytie. In the deathlike stillness of the house he heard the sharp
      striking of a match. He waited for a moment or two and then went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie, in her hat and cloak, was reading, by the light of her bedroom
      candle, a letter that had arrived by the last post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in for one minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;for two if you like. Do you know, I had an idle fancy
      that I should see you when I got home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? I am very glad; it assures me that you don't think me&mdash;what
      shall I say?&mdash;presumptuous in waiting for you to come in and then
      intruding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you listen for me? You are good. I am scarcely worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt I must thank you for your little note&mdash;and the picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? And are we going to make friends again, Mr. Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him in the face proudly, yet laughingly, and held out her
      ungloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I behaved very badly to you this morning, and you
      must thank Winifred for bringing me to a sense of decency; but really when
      I saw the dear child's work done to death by my own fault I was not
      mistress of myself. I suppose it is best when one is in the wrong to own
      it&mdash;to one's friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sensible,&rdquo; said Kent, &ldquo;and I am very proud of your reckoning me
      among your friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, a strange little smile playing round the corner of her
      lips as she put up both hands to withdraw her hat-pin&mdash;a graceful
      attitude, instinct with femininity. The look and the attitude disconcerted
      Kent for a moment. However, her next words reassured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judged you by myself, you know. I had found our friendship a pleasant
      thing, and felt that you did so, too, and I was sorry lest anything should
      break it; otherwise I should not have taken the trouble to 'climb down,'
      as they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us say no more about it,&rdquo; replied Kent magnanimously. &ldquo;If we pride
      ourselves on being superior to certain conventionalities of habit, we
      ought to extend our conventionalities of sentiment. I have been very
      troubled all day, Miss Davenant, I must confess, and I can't tell you how
      touched I was by your message. It's not every woman by a long way that
      would have sent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I would not have written it to every man,&rdquo; returned Clytie; &ldquo;of that
      you may be quite certain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so they parted for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the breach between them was quite covered over and their relations
      strengthened by a newer impression of mutual dependence, a more active
      sense of comradeship. They laughed frankly at the Great Conventionalities,
      and went about together to theatres, concerts, picture-shows. Kent
      accompanied her to Mrs. Farquharson's Sunday evenings, where he found a
      ready welcome from the artistic and literary circle, to whom his father
      had been well known. Mrs. Farquharson called them &ldquo;Orestia and Pylades,&rdquo;
       by this time recognising their companionship as a social fact. They always
      went back together, generally for a great part of the way on foot when the
      weather grew warm and the nights were dry and clear. On the weekday
      evenings, when Clytie was at home, Kent would bring down his work and his
      reference-books to Clytie's room, and write there, while she drew or read
      or busied herself with odds and ends of needlework. It had all the outward
      seeming of friendship&mdash;nothing more. For hours they would sit
      together without exchanging a word&mdash;a real test. But Clytie grew
      interested in the progress of Kent's work, gradually obtained a clear idea
      of its scope and proportion, and could speak intimately to him concerning
      it, although its matter was as incomprehensible to her as to any other
      non-specialist. It gave the girl, too, a sense of rest and strength to see
      him sitting there, patiently, serenely working. She began to have doubts
      as to the completeness of her own scheme of life, its worthiness,
      satisfaction. Hitherto the sense of independence, freedom, accumulating
      knowledge of that whose foreshadowings had filled her girlish heart with
      unrest, had almost satisfied her. Now she began to look beyond. With her
      young being as yet untouched by passion, she did not realise the fulness
      that love must bring into life. She vaguely speculated upon it, faint,
      elusive gleams of perception passing rapidly through her into the
      darkness, but that was all. The secret of life, she thought, could only be
      wrested from the tangle of the labyrinth by single-minded endeavour,
      sacrifice, devotion. Was not Kent right when he accused her of making her
      art a stepping-stone instead of an end?
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent, manlike, and honester, too, than most men, was unconscious of this
      self-abasement. Since the day of that fierce struggle with herself which
      had resulted in her sending him the missive of submission he had vaguely
      felt that she was dependent on him for many things; but he had helped her
      in his frank, unquestioning way, feeling pleased, warmed by the flame of a
      newly kindled spark of vanity. He preached to her his simple doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work while work pleases you. Love it for its own sake. Set a great end
      before you; but the attaining it is the delight, not the ultimate
      attainment. If you think of nothing but the end, the reaching it is all
      feverish unrest and toil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened, rebelled, submitted, without loss of her proud fearlessness.
      Yes; it was common sense, she agreed. No one can be humiliated by giving
      in to common sense and acting in accordance with it. Kent persuaded her to
      finish the picture of Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the best thing you have done. There is more work in it&mdash;real
      work. It will not take long to finish. Then send it for exhibition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He appealed to Winifred, who added her soft note of encouragement. The
      picture was painted. Kent stonily refused to keep it as his possession.
      There was a heated argument. He valued her gift and her friendship; he
      valued her fame and life-interest more. He would not refuse a replica. In
      the end she acquiesced. The picture was accepted by the hanging committee
      of the exhibition, made a stir, was sold for £120. Clytie was launched..

      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he summer came.
      Clytie went abroad with the Farquharsons, through the old towns of
      Normandy and Brittany. Kent joined them at St. Malo, and spent his month's
      holiday with them. This was such a departure from his usual habit of
      solitary pedestrian travel in the rough wilds of Norway, whither he went
      every year, with little else than a stick and a knapsack, that Wither had
      been quite alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be taking a holiday with me next,&rdquo; he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But knowing the terms of intimacy between his friend and Clytie, and
      knowing Clytie herself,&mdash;he had accompanied Kent to the studio, at
      first out of curiosity to see what kind of &ldquo;being feminine&rdquo; Kent had made
      a friend of, and afterwards because he liked to go there,&mdash;whatever
      sceptical imaginings might have exercised him, he forbore to give them
      expression. He had only looked at Kent, on saying good-bye, in his odd,
      half-mocking way, and had chuckled noiselessly to himself when the door
      had closed upon Kent's broad shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent did not regret Norway. A charm, unknown to him before, filled all the
      days. The Farquharsons were perfect travelling companions: Caroline
      bright, satirical, helpful, learned in the ways of men; George easy-going,
      happy either to lounge in the sun with a pipe and bandy chaff with his
      wife, whilst Kent and Clytie went their own ways, or to spend an
      antiquarian afternoon with Kent in some old Keltic village. Clytie seemed
      also to him to expand under the sunny cheerful influences, to grow more
      feminine, without falling in his estimation. No; he did not regret Norway.
      He half formulated an intention of abandoning it permanently and
      substituting Brittany as his habitual tramping-ground. From the first
      morning, when his boat steamed slowly through the narrow St. Malo docks,
      and he saw Clytie waiting there to meet him, he felt friendly towards it.
      The high ramparted wall, with just the top-story row of green shutters and
      roofs peeping above it, and beyond them the spire of the cathedral; the
      glimpse through the sentry-guarded gate up the narrow cobble-paved street,
      gaudy with blue blouses, red handkerchiefs, and yellow oilskins exposed
      all along at shop doors; on the quay itself the stalls of the hucksters
      under the lee of the wall, and the busy crowd of swarthy Breton sailors,
      porters, and green uniformed <i>douaniers</i>; and Clytie standing, fresh
      in her pure colouring heightened by the light summer dress, in the midst
      of this mellow setting&mdash;all the picture fixed itself as a whole
      indelibly upon his mind, and caused a strange little thrill of pleasure to
      run through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat on the sands&mdash;the finest in the world, perhaps, when the
      tide is low&mdash;that run in a broad, golden sweep from crag-bastioned,
      grim old St. Malo to the white houses of Parame, amid the babel of bathers
      and visitors, watching the types Parisian and English, Kent smoking
      contentedly, while Clytie filled her sketch-book with oddities of
      personality and costume. Three days slipped away there very pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of its banality as a pleasure resort there is a grim charm about
      St. Malo that is never quite forgotten by those who have once known it. It
      has an air of stability, of defiance. It is out of the reach of the
      improver, extender, and suburb-maker. Its great walls guard it as
      jealously on three sides as the sea does on the other. Almost alone of
      populous cities, it can never grow. As he left with the party to continue
      the tour Kent felt this charm, although his associations with the city had
      been of the lighter kind. They idled through the old towns: Dol, with its
      dark granite cathedral, looking rather hewn out of the rock than built;
      Dinan on its granite steep above the Rance, where the heart of du Guesclin
      is enshrined; Brieux, Paimpol, over which Pierre Loti has thrown the
      glamour of his sentiment; Morlaix, and so to Brest, with its great harbour
      and strong sea breeze from the Atlantic. For Kent this journey was an
      uninterrupted pleasure. No country is richer in things old, worn by
      weather and time, than Brittany: here an old chapel built of rough unhewn
      granite; here a shapeless wayside cross erected by some pious crusader on
      the ragged hill slope, railed round to prevent the encroachments of the
      broom and heather; here a Druidic mass of boulders; in the cottages
      curious smoke-dried strips of old Breton work, ancestral oak carvings,
      rude brass repousée platters&mdash;a thousand antiquarian interests in
      this gray land. But it is a bright one withal. The fields of yellow colza
      stretch over the landscape in broad patches of glory; the red-cheeked
      cider apples glow in the orchards. The chestnut-trees in the grounds of
      the old feudal château, its fleched gables dimly visible, hang gratefully
      over the high bounding wall, above the roadway. The peasants still wear
      the picturesque Breton dress, tasselled hats, embroidered short jackets,
      and knee-breeches for the men, great white caps and elaborate kirtles for
      the women. Along the coast the surf beats in a line of angry light upon
      the rocks, and shows white, in the midst of the blue, around the islets
      out at sea. And the old fishing villages look as if they were but flotsam
      and jetsam cast up by Providence around the gray, weather-worn church that
      has taken them to its bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few days after they left Dinan Kent noticed a change in Clytie. She
      was reserved, thoughtful. It was not until she appeared to have thrown off
      the weight of an obsessing idea that she grew buoyant and frank again. An
      incident unknown to him had occurred at Dinan, shaking the girl's heart to
      its depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bedroom in the hotel opened, like the others on the same floor, on to
      a small balcony, the spaces in front of each room being separated by a
      light iron bar. She was dressing one morning when her attention was
      aroused by voices in the next room, near the balcony. Her own French
      window was open. The air was sunny and still, and the voices struck clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is your last word?&rdquo; asked a woman's voice in French. She used
      the familiar <i>ton</i>. Her accents were tearful and pleading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied a man's voice brutally. &ldquo;There, there! Do not make any
      scenes. I go because it is my good pleasure. What have you to say against
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I love you, I love you, Armand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; laughed the man, &ldquo;they say that always. Here are the thousand
      francs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie, who had involuntarily overheard this scrap of the conversation,
      hastened to shut the window. The sounds died away into murmurs dimly
      perceptible through the partition wall. Then she heard the room door slam
      violently and a heavy step tramp down the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two hours later she was sitting in the salon of the hotel, reading
      the papers and looking idly out upon the market-booths in the little <i>place</i>.
      Kent and Farquharson had gone out together to devote a scientific forenoon
      to the monuments of the town, and Caroline was writing letters in her own
      room. Clytie was alone. Suddenly the door opened and a woman, scarcely
      more than a girl, appeared on the threshold. She made a step forward, but
      perceiving Clytie by the window, she hesitated, irresolute whether to
      advance or retire. Clytie looked up quickly, caught a glance which she
      interpreted as one of appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, enter, mademoiselle,&rdquo; she said, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newcomer murmured a &ldquo;<i>Merci</i>,&rdquo; entered, closed the door, and
      sitting down on the faded sofa by the wall, commenced turning over the
      pages of an old illustrated paper. Clytie went on with her <i>Figaro</i>.
      Presently her ear caught a little sniffling sob. She turned round. Her
      companion was squeezing a wet rag of a handkerchief in her hand, her head
      turned away towards the paper; she was crying. Clytie rose, moved softly
      across the room. But as she was going through the doorway she saw the
      girl, abandoning herself to her misery, bury her face upon the sofa
      cushion. Clytie was touched. She went back to the girl, laid her hand
      softly on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl started, raised a pretty, tear-stained face, looked at Clytie
      wistfully out of her light blue eyes, her lips quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are in trouble,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mademoiselle, you are very good,&rdquo; cried the other&mdash;&ldquo;<i>oui; je
      suis bien malheureuse</i>. But you must leave me. You are a young girl
      well brought up, whilst I&mdash;&mdash;<i>Merci</i>, mademoiselle; you can
      do nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice struck a chord of association. Where had she heard it recently?
      Quickly it flashed upon her, the scrap of dialogue she had overheard that
      morning. The girl again hid her face. The low-cut dress, beloved by
      Frenchwomen, disclosed a shapely neck, on which clustered coquettishly a
      few tiny madcap curls below the smooth, upbrushed, fair hair. Her figure
      was young and graceful, relaxed now in the attitude of abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie looked down upon her wonderingly, her heart beating. Her maidenhood
      urged her to fly; a higher sense of life bade her stay a moment by the
      sobbing figure. She had never, to her knowledge, been near to one of the
      great unclassed&mdash;still less spoken. She remembered the few cynical
      words of the man; they seemed to give her a pain at the heart akin to
      nausea. She remembered the pleading tones: &ldquo;<i>Je t'aime Je t'aime bien!</i>&rdquo;
       and her pity went forth upon the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ask you to tell me,&rdquo; she said very gently. &ldquo;But we may talk a
      little, mayn't we? Perhaps it may ease you&mdash;a woman&mdash;the same
      age,&rdquo;&mdash;Clytie stumbled in the foreign language,&mdash;&ldquo;and perhaps
      not so well brought up&mdash;after all, a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mademoiselle, you do not understand. This life!&rdquo; her shoulders
      shivered expressively. &ldquo;After all, it is bearable; but when, with all
      that, one loves&mdash;ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not worth it,&rdquo; cried Clytie. &ldquo;He is a scoundrel&mdash;I know what
      he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl raised her face quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him? You know Armand? Ah, no; you spoke at random. Yes, he is
      base, cruel, but that does not prevent it. Mademoiselle, you are good, you
      are sweet. It is not many who would have spoken. You will let me sit here
      near you for a little? Ah, <i>mon Dieu</i>,&rdquo; she went on rapidly, &ldquo;you
      cannot imagine what it is&mdash;never, never to talk to a woman whom one
      can respect, and who may not betray you; and then the only persons one can
      respect are the men, who despise one. And even they&mdash;one can love
      them, but they are cowardly, hard, selfish!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are some good men,&rdquo; observed Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; returned the other, finally drying her eyes, and putting up
      her hand to her hair in tidying touches&mdash;&ldquo;that may be, but we don't
      often see them. Oh, mademoiselle, I know well that I should be ashamed of
      showing you what I am, but when you touched my shoulder it was like a good
      sister of the convent,&rdquo;&mdash;Clytie smiled in spite of herself at the
      comparison,&mdash;&ldquo;and it touched my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too have a confession to make,&rdquo; said Clytie, gently interrupting.
      &ldquo;This morning&mdash;I overheard&mdash;my room is next to yours&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it was you who shut the window?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. So I know, mademoiselle&mdash;at least I can judge. And are you
      quite alone now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you have? He has gone, and I must go too. One does not amuse
      oneself here alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Paris. In the middle of summer. It is not gay. Everyone will know <i>qu'il
      via plantée là</i>. But one must live. Ah! you are happy, you other honest
      women!&rdquo; She talked on, in half-cynical, half-artless confidence, as is the
      way of her race, forgetting in her need of expansion that her hearer was
      the English girl well brought up. She dilated on her present trouble, her
      life in Paris, her creditors, the spitefulness of women, the brutality of
      men. Clytie listened with mingled feelings of horror and pity. She was so
      young, this girl, so fresh for all the soil of Paris, and yet taking, from
      use, the whole horror of her life as a matter of course, realising it only
      in rare emotional moments. Here was a rejecter of formulas, of a race that
      has thrown off convention ever since Rahab harboured the spies! Too
      fragile, delicate she looked for this social warfare. Whither was she
      tending? Clytie had a supreme, lurid moment of introspection. Only two or
      three such come in a lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the girl rose from the sofa in the quick French way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, mademoiselle, for talking like this. I had forgotten. You see
      well that you could not have helped me otherwise than you have done by
      sitting by my side. I must not encroach upon your time. Adieu,
      mademoiselle, and thank you; oh, a thousand times, thanks. I shall not
      forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was going. Clytie rose and went towards her, her face a little
      flushed, but kindness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will shake hands, <i>à l'Anglaise?</i>&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked her quickly in the face, and then impulsively seized the
      proffered hand in both hers and kissed it twice rapidly. Then she ran from
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie went back to her seat by the window and looked out upon the
      market-sellers. But she did not see much, as tears stood in her eyes and
      rolled down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell Mrs. Farquharson of this incident, but kept it in her
      heart as a secret and strange revelation of life&mdash;something precious,
      mysterious, awful. During her drive with the others in the afternoon she
      was strangely silent. Kent rallied her on her depression in his bluff,
      kind-hearted manner. She smiled absently, complained of a headache, then
      shivered with a wave of recollection. For days the spectre haunted her,
      sometimes looking at her through the light blue eyes of the girl, and
      sometimes taking a dual form, in which the coarse drudge features of the
      mother of Jack, the model, were dimly visible. And a question hummed in
      her ears: &ldquo;Was this the aspect of life that men kept so jealously hidden
      from women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Clytie was young and vigorous, with fresh bright blood leaping in her
      veins. The thrill of the salt breeze and the whole-hearted laughter of her
      friends soon prevented these imaginings from becoming morbid, and
      gradually the first sharp impression dulled more or less down to the level
      of her other experiences of things. She gave herself up again to the
      freedom and gaiety of the trip, to the unfeigned delight of Kent, who had
      been beginning to wonder whether, for unknown reasons, some coolness had
      arisen between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forbore to allude to the subject until the night when they were all
      returning together from St. Malo to Southampton. He had found her a
      sheltered corner of the upper deck, rigged up a screen of rugs,
      comfortably established her in a canvas chair with many wraps. Most of the
      passengers had gone below. They were almost alone. The voices of two men
      in an opposite corner came vaguely out of the darkness. All was still save
      for the continuous rattle and wash, which at sea forms a strange kind of
      silence in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you sorry it is over?&rdquo; asked Clytie from the dimness of her wraps.
      &ldquo;We did nothing very wonderful, but it has been very pleasant&mdash;a
      thing to look back upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A garnered joy for after-time.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are waxing poetical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's Wither. He was poetical in his youth. You would hardly think
      it of him. I have always thought that line rather pretty. Anyhow, it is
      true in the present case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we haven't quarrelled,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;in spite of the maxim, 'If you
      want to lose a friend, travel with him.' But I don't think I could quarrel
      with you. You wrap yourself round with such imperturbable superiority.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The metaphor is mixed, but proceed,&rdquo; interrupted Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's not worth while playing to such a bad house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what we should have to quarrel about,&rdquo; returned Kent,
      laughing. &ldquo;We each give the other credit for independent opinions; and as
      for action, if you wanted to go to the right and I to the left, I suppose
      I should give in and let you have your way&mdash;if it were not contrary
      to common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if it were? If it were simply idiotic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should go with you then, to keep you out of harm's way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; murmured Clytie rather touched, looking up restfully at the
      stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little silence. Kent puffed at his pipe. The glow attracted
      George Farquharson, who had just come up on the deck and was groping about
      for them in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to stay here all night?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of it,&rdquo; replied Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent making you comfortable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie murmured an easeful affirmative, and Farquharson, nodding a
      good-night, disappeared into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apropos of quarrelling,&rdquo; said Kent after a while. &ldquo;Do you know, I thought
      once, for a few days, you were vexed with me for something&mdash;after we
      left Dinan. Were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie felt the words like a touch of ice. Why had Kent blundered so
      tactlessly?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why do you mention that?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The only painful thing in all
      the trip. Something that I saw at Dinan&mdash;I was put out. Was I very
      disagreeable? It did not refer to you in any way, dear friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me if I have touched on a sore place,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;I find I
      have a good deal to learn in these matters. Will you make a compact with
      me to tell me if ever I offend you? Your friendship has grown so valuable
      and dear a thing to me that the idea of running the risk of losing it
      makes me&mdash;what shall I say? Well, I couldn't bear it. I don't often
      talk like this,&mdash;sentiment comes out of me very awkwardly,&mdash;but
      when I do say anything of the sort I mean it. Believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie put out her gloved hand and touched him lightly on the arm. She,
      too, felt that she had certain need of him. A little thrill of tenderness
      passed through her as she turned her head towards him to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I call you 'dear friend' just now? And I meant it, too. You are
      too honest, too single-hearted, ever to offend me, as you say. If I am
      ever rebellious with you it will be my own fault, and I shall know it. And
      as I really have got some common sense, I shall be sorry for it. But you
      won't expect me to tell you so every time, will you? You will have to take
      it for granted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always make yourself out worse than you are,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;Very few
      people know you. The Farquharsons, myself, Winifred, do. I should like to
      go with you wherever you go, and tell folks not to believe you, to prove
      to them what a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop! stop!&rdquo; cried Clytie, with a little laugh. &ldquo;This sojourn in the
      land of compliments has infected you. Oh, no; I am ordinary; not bad, not
      good. You see, if I had had anybody to care for specially, and who cared
      for me, I might have shown up differently. I have hardly had a chance of
      seeming otherwise than selfish. Opportunity makes the saint as much as it
      makes the thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent meditated, framing a reply. The right words would not come until it
      seemed that too long an interval had elapsed. There was another silence&mdash;one
      of those pleasant ones between friends when they feel in sympathy. Clytie
      at last broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have had such a conversation as this with a man friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;at least&mdash;well, no. Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. The idea occurred to me,&rdquo; replied Clytie.

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he long autumn
      months rolled on, bringing little new to Clytie or to Kent. Clytie
      continued to paint her small <i>genre</i> pictures, but with a more
      certain touch, a restraint which a deeper insight into life compelled.
      They did not satisfy her now, however, as they used to. She had more
      articulate longings after an art which should be higher, more
      comprehensive, more responsive to certain subtler and at the same time
      more stirring impulses within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to paint something that may live,&rdquo; she said to Kent, &ldquo;something I
      can throw my whole soul into, something I can look at when it is finished
      and say: 'There, that is final; that expresses consummately everything I
      have ever felt and dreamed.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can ever say that, you will cease to be an artist,&rdquo; he replied in
      his matter-of-fact way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so. But I must try. And the subject, the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;If it ever comes, it will do so of itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie waited, but the subject did not come. Meanwhile she had her hands
      full with orders, both for pictures and for magazine illustrations. Her
      life was full, as far as work could make it. Winifred came regularly to
      the studio, as usual, cheering her with sweet companionship. She had spent
      her summer holiday at the seaside, treating out of her own purse her two
      little brothers to a holiday. She came back with glowing reminiscences of
      her adventures, the humorous naughtinesses of the children, the odds and
      ends of character she had met with. Her only regret was that her dear
      Clytie had not been there too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thrown those horrid children, Reggie and Arthur, into the
      sea!&rdquo; exclaimed Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, you wouldn't. They simply adore you. They are nice children,
      aren't they, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little goose!&rdquo; cried Clytie, kissing the warm brown cheek. &ldquo;They are
      like you, the sweetest little children in the world. When are they coming
      to tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These teas in the studio were red-letter days for Winifred's brothers and
      sisters. They worshipped Clytie, who had keen sympathy with the
      unconventionalities of childhood. She made grotesque caricatures of them,
      at which they screamed with laughter, or sat on the hearthrug with them
      and talked the nonsense that bright children love. Their joy was complete
      if Kent came in. They called him &ldquo;Kent,&rdquo; took complete possession of him,
      presented him to Clytie as a pet trifle they carried about with them. He,
      too, was fond of these debauches, and seldom missed attending them if he
      could leave the Museum in time. He loved to see Clytie take her part in
      them. She seemed to him even more sweet and womanly than Winifred when she
      had a child on her lap, and her dark red hair was touching the black
      ruffled curls. He told her so one day, and the colour came into her cheeks
      as she laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another occasional visitor in the studio was Treherne, the young clergyman
      whom Clytie had met at the Farquharson's numismatic dinner-party. Kent and
      herself had run across him at a Bond Street gallery where some paintings
      by the impressionists Degas and Monet were on view. He was looking ill and
      overworked. He replied to their inquiries that he had been forced to give
      up his North London parish and take lighter duties near Victoria. As he
      lived in her neighbourhood, he hoped that Clytie would allow him to call
      one day and see her pictures; &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; at the exhibition had aroused his
      admiration. Clytie readily gave him her &ldquo;day,&rdquo; when Miss Marchpane and
      herself were at home to their friends, and hoped he would come. He called,
      found a certain charm in the bright talk of the studio, exhilarating after
      the dull rounds among his parishioners, and soon became a constant
      visitor. Perhaps the charm of a pair of soft brown eyes attracted him more
      than he thought of confessing. Towards the end of the year, however, he
      bought, through a dealer, two of Winifred's dainty pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days shortened, the painting light grew less and less, and the time
      came for Clytie to pay her Christmas visit to Durdleham. She had not been
      there for a year, and her heart longed at times for the familiar faces and
      the voices of her own kith and kin. She thought that, perhaps, now she had
      grown older, her father and sisters would think her mode of life less
      unnatural, less likely to result in moral shipwreck. The letters, too, she
      had been receiving from them lately were kinder, more affectionate in
      tone. Mrs. Blather longed to have her dear Clytie back amongst them once
      more, and Janet wrote touchingly of the vacant chair at the dinner table.
      Clytie anticipated much quiet pleasure from her visit. The need of an
      attitude of rebellion was past, and she could throw herself lovingly, with
      no fear of compromising her independence, into all the mild interests of
      the household. There were times when a tenderer, softer chord vibrated in
      her heart, suggesting sadly the sweetness of home and loved family ties.
      She was human, with the foolish human craving for things that are not. She
      could not abandon her free artistic life; but if she could fill it with
      gentler, softer graces! In these moods she clung to Winifred, loving her
      for this element of sweet womanliness she brought into the rooms in the
      King's Road that were her home. It was with this range of feelings
      uppermost in her heart that she went to Durdleham.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first few days after Clytie's departure Kent laboured honestly and
      doggedly in his old way. But gradually he began to feel a lack of interest
      in his pursuits, to be vaguely conscious that the conditions of things
      were upset, and then he wished that Clytie had not gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he was sitting in his room with a litter of proof-sheets lying
      idly before him. He felt depressed. It was a new sensation. It puzzled
      him, annoyed him, made him angry with himself, like a man's first
      unsuspected attack of the gout. He rose and walked about. His fire had
      nearly gone out, his lamp had been flaring and the room was filled with
      its acrid smoke. He could not open the window, for the sleet and rain were
      beating against the panes. He stopped for a moment watching the water
      dribble outside down the glass. Then he turned away impatiently, seeking
      solace from his book-backs and pictures. But they seemed to look back upon
      him unsympathetically, as if reproaching him for the bare floor, the
      untidy dresser, and the cheerless hearth. He rekindled his fire, filled a
      pipe, and sat down to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent was not given to introspection. His external interests in life were
      too engrossing for him to think deeply or continuously about himself. Such
      a habit of mind he used vehemently to deprecate as morbid, egotistical.
      But now this strange depression, this vague sense of loss, compelled him
      to account for it to his reason. He began in a sober, materialistic way to
      review his general health (there are philosophers amongst us who refer all
      moods to the liver, not looking upon it, however, like the ancients, as
      the seat of the affections!), to question some little disappointments he
      had had with regard to his great work, and to dwell upon the futility of
      existence&mdash;the suggestion of which he should have been logical enough
      to see was the result and not the cause of his state of mind. But he was
      not logical. Few men are when the great facts of inner life are in
      question; for in the course of logic &ldquo;none of us would see salvation,&rdquo; as
      far as this world's happiness is concerned. Gradually a truth dawned upon
      him. He missed the ever-ready companionship he had enjoyed for nearly a
      year. He missed Clytie. He found that for the first time in his life since
      he was a baby he had been depending for something on a woman. He had never
      realised until then the strength of that unknown subtle influence, the
      withdrawal of which left him so weak, so unable to put forth all his
      powers. At first he thought that it was merely the abrupt interruption of
      pleasant habits, the sudden jerk out of a well-oiled groove. Telling
      himself he was satisfied with this solution, he resolutely went back to
      his writing and began to correct his proof-sheets. But gradually his
      attention wandered again. These sudden impulses to work against the grain
      soon spend themselves out and produce greater lassitude than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tossed down his pencil in disgust and swung round towards the fire. It
      was Clytie herself, then, that he missed. He missed her in spite of her
      being a woman, he told himself. And yet the picture rose before his mind
      of Clytie's dainty room and Clytie sitting there opposite to him, her
      hand, with falling lace at wrist, pressed into the softness of her hair.
      Why had she not written a line to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he missed her. But why should that make his work distasteful? He was
      puzzled. One thing alone was clear, his loneliness was growing
      intolerable. He threw on his waterproof, and, leaving his work, trudged
      through the rain to the &ldquo;monastery,&rdquo; at South Kensington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wither was alone. Fairfax and Greene were dining out. The little man had
      been too lazy and sybaritic to face the cold and wet outside. He had clad
      himself in pyjamas and dressing-gown, and was reading a French novel on
      the couch drawn up in front of the fire. His diminutive figure looked
      absurdly small and wizened in his loose wrap. He nodded affectionately at
      Kent, explained briefly the fact of his being alone, and, while Kent was
      hunting in a familiar corner for the pair of slippers always there in
      readiness for his use, went on with his reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get me some whiskey, old chap,&rdquo; he said without looking up. &ldquo;I have been
      dying for some this last hour and I have been too lazy to stir off the
      sofa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent, as usual, supplied Wither's wants and poured out a glass for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lazy little beggar,&rdquo; he said kindly as he sat down in the great
      saddle-bag chair. &ldquo;How do you manage to get through your work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you knew better than to ask me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a tradition in the &ldquo;monastery&rdquo; that Wither never did any work. They
      paid him at his office for lending it a gentlemanly tone. As a matter of
      fact, like most clever, lazy men, he generally did an ordinary man's day's
      work in a few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stretched himself out luxuriously and lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever read this?&rdquo; he asked, holding up his novel. It was
      Bourget's &ldquo;Cruelle Enigme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I skimmed it through here one night while waiting for you. I have no
      patience with that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly not,&rdquo; remarked Wither, &ldquo;but that's a fact about yourself, and
      not about the book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it is human life,&rdquo; replied Kent. &ldquo;People can't make
      animal passion the keynote of their lives nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not nowadays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The conditions of life prevent it. The savage has furious brute
      instincts, which he gratifies occasionally, when his mind is not taken up
      with fighting and hunting for his food. It may be the guiding principle in
      a splendid barbarism like some Eastern courts, where men have little else
      to think of. But in our modern civilisation there are other interests too
      absorbing. The hurry of life is too great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about the empty-minded women you are always railing at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all absorbed in their futilities&mdash;at least most of them,&rdquo;
       he added, correcting himself; &ldquo;but even when idle they are not beasts. Now
      this woman you are reading about is a beast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither eyed him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are talking nonsense, old chap. If she had been simply that, she
      would not have been a problem to the psychologist. The enigma was the
      sudden burst into animalism in the midst of a love that was almost
      idyllic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;It was the same old hideous adultery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well! if you go on those lines, I am done,&rdquo; replied Wither, shrugging
      his shoulders. &ldquo;I thought we were a little more advanced in our ideas in
      this establishment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I don't mean that,&rdquo; said Kent, puffing violently at his pipe.
      &ldquo;The legality of the connection has nothing to do with it. It is the
      eternal coupling of the male and the female that revolts me. Pah! They
      might as well write a novel on the loves of the pastures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could write French, I should like to try it,&rdquo; said Wither. &ldquo;It would
      be interesting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is too much of that sort of thing written and talked about,&rdquo; said
      Kent. &ldquo;It's sickening. It's degradation of humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's not uncommon,&rdquo; said Wither, with a sphinxlike smile playing
      round the corners of his mouth as he gazed upwards at the cigarette smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Wither,&rdquo; said Kent; &ldquo;I have a higher faith in humanity. You
      profess to be a cynic, a man of the world, and you delight in calling
      yourself nonmoral. That's all foolishness, I know. You are the kindest
      hearted little chap in the world. But can you, as a man of intellectual
      tastes, sympathise with all this animalism?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither threw away his cigarette, and bending forward laid his hand on
      Kent's knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear old boy,&rdquo; he said, with more earnestness than he generally
      displayed, &ldquo;I do call myself a man of the world, for I'm in it and I love
      it, and I have a very decent bowing acquaintance as well with its pals,
      the Flesh and the Devil. I know something of men, and as for women, it has
      been my lot to have been petted by a good few&mdash;my size lends itself
      to that sort of thing. In fact, Gulliver with the Brobdingnag maids of
      honour is not in it with me. I know all about 'em; and I tell you, old
      chap, that the Beast, sometimes with a big B and sometimes in diamond
      type, lies in the nature of us all. There is not a living being with pure
      blood in his or her veins who is not overmastered at times by the
      principle of sex. You scoff at Bourget as a writer of morbid and
      impossible fiction. Look at your daily papers. Don't you see parsons of
      hitherto blameless lives running off with their cooks, virtuous women
      ruining their lives and their husbands' for the sake of some Hercules of a
      scoundrel&mdash;just as the patrician ladies in Rome went mad over the
      charioteers in the circus! Man alive! it is the Beast, the Beast that may
      slumber in an old maid's bosom until she is sixty and then drive her into
      the arms of her footman. How otherwise have you accounted for these
      things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not tried,&rdquo; replied Kent simply. &ldquo;They have not interested me.
      They are diseases of the brain, for the physiologist to study, like
      suicide and murder. I don't believe in them in normal everyday life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause, broken only by Wither's request that Kent should
      put some coals on the fire, and the rattling of the operation. Wither
      resumed his reading and Kent pulled at his pipe in silence. At last the
      former looked up and said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think people marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's funny,&rdquo; replied Kent, with a slight start. &ldquo;I was just wondering
      myself. I don't know: money, companionship, family, idiocy&mdash;God knows
      what.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has always struck me that you would be the first of us to go,&rdquo; said
      the other in pure, idle maliciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried Kent, with a gesture of disgust. &ldquo;I marry! give up my work,
      procreate children I couldn't support! Have to kiss and pet and fondle a
      woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you need not do that unless you like,&rdquo; replied Wither, laughing in
      his gnomelike way. &ldquo;She might expect it, but she would be soon consoled by
      the blessedness of pure spirituality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent's reply was interrupted by the return of the absentees, Fairfax, the
      doctor, and Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you fellows have come back,&rdquo; said Kent; &ldquo;Wither has been
      drivelling on his favourite topic until I was beginning to loathe him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's an immoral little wretch,&rdquo; said the doctor, throwing his greatcoat
      on Wither's curled-up body&mdash;&ldquo;a pocket Mephistopheles. We keep him
      here as a kind of Familiar. Oh, what rot dining out is!&rdquo; he added, with a
      yawn and a stretch as he seated his burly form on the foot of the couch.
      &ldquo;I wish I had stayed at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;Let us have just one rubber before I go.
      There is time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Kent walked home that night with a new trouble at his heart that kept
      him awake a great part of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Clytie was not enjoying herself at Durdleham. At first there
      were eager embraces, trifling tendernesses and solicitudes. The dear
      prodigal had returned, but the fatted calf was killed discreetly, lest it
      should convey a husk-flavoured reproach. Grace and Janet bubbled over with
      light Durdleham gossip, seeking to interest, and Clytie earnestly and
      sympathetically sought to be in touch with her surroundings. It was a real
      heartfelt effort on both sides towards harmony. But it soon became patent
      that these efforts were unavailing. Clytie saw the old prejudices barring
      her at every turn. She recognised with the bitterness of disillusionment
      that she was the bit of grit in the family machinery, stopping the
      smoothness of its working. As long as she identified herself with
      Durdleham interests things went well; but as soon as she, in her turn,
      ventured to sketch the bright incidents in her town life she felt a check
      in the current of mutual sympathy. If she was reserved, her sisters
      complained. They ought to know something of her friends, her occupations.
      When she was expansive they shrank cold and crablike into their mail of
      prejudice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her intimacy with a strange Bohemian man was a thorn in the side of the
      family. Mr. Davenant considered it extremely injudicious, and Mrs. Blather
      whispered to him that she scarcely thought it moral. Janet was too
      horrified to allude directly to the circumstance. But, in her neat, prim
      bedchamber, she prayed to the Almighty to lead her erring sister out of
      the paths of temptation. She duly informed Clytie of this act of piety,
      and when Clytie burst into laughter that was nearer to tears than to
      merriment, left the room in virtuous indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie could not help confessing to herself that she longed for Kent's
      companionship, with its broader sympathies and inspiring influences, but
      the view the household took of it pained her with a sense of aching
      discomfort, and made her feel a strange diffidence in writing to him as
      she had promised. She at last addressed him a short little note, stiff and
      constrained, which reached him the morning after his conversation with
      Wither and did not help to cheer him. Too proud to wait for an opportunity
      of posting this letter herself, she placed it on the hall slab together
      with the rest of the outgoing correspondence of the family. Although a
      hundred letters might have lain there for post without any one of them
      attracting Mrs. Blather's attention,&mdash;she was too pure-minded a
      gentlewoman for idle curiosity to be one of her failings,&mdash;it was too
      good an opportunity for the imps who seem sometimes to regulate human
      affairs to let slip, and as a matter of course Mrs. Blather's eye fell
      upon the address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are keeping up a violent correspondence with that man,&rdquo; she
      remarked acidly to Clytie. It is the way of some women to exaggerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie bit her lip, cheeking an impulsive answer. What was the use of a
      retort?
    </p>
    <p>
      Women of broad, liberal education, with interests beyond the nursery,
      still-room, and the afternoon-tea table, are known to live together, like
      men, in comparative harmony. They have learned the lesson the higher,
      broader life teaches of rising or declining instinctively to another
      being's plane of thought or feeling. It is hardly a fault of sex that
      women are petty, spiteful, and intolerant. When the conditions of life are
      narrow and illiberal any human being, man or woman, runs the risk of being
      shaped by them. And that is why Mrs. Blather and Janet, good, upright
      women according to their lights, subordinated their affection to their
      principles, and stood away shocked from their sister. Their traditional
      ideals of femininity had been sinned against. The crime was all but
      unpardonable. It was always present with them, always assuming fresh,
      distorted shapes. They were on a different plane from Clytie, and viewed
      all her actions in a false perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie was hurt, wounded in her womanly pride. She knew that there was
      much clay in her composition, and often felt with chastening
      self-abasement how much nearer the angels Winifred was than herself. Yet
      she was accustomed to live in an atmosphere free from reproach. Winifred,
      Kent, the Farquharsons, and others of her friends might touch with light,
      tender finger on here and there an imperfection in her character or
      conduct; for this she was grateful, knowing the deeper feelings of esteem
      and respect that prompted. But to move in a circle where she was looked
      upon as a black sheep, as a girl on the path to unutterable abysses,
      galled her to the quick, sent the hot blood mounting in stinging waves to
      her cheek, leaving the heart cold. Yet she had learned not to blame her
      sisters over much. She had lost her militant scorn of Jacob. Kent had
      taught her that although Esau might possess the higher birthright which no
      bartering of pottage could alienate, there was still saving grace in the
      stolen birthright which Jacob guarded so jealously. But this knowledge did
      not make her heart less sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiest time in this Christmas visit was when she could get away into
      the old lumber-attic in which she had dreamed so many girlish dreams. It
      had long been dismantled of the Liberty curtains, Persian rugs, and cheap
      Japaneseries that had lent it the suggestion of artistic atmosphere the
      girl of eighteen had craved. It was bare now, except for a table and chair
      and a few odds and ends of artist's materials, but a fire could be laid in
      the grate to make things look cheery, and there was still the deeply
      recessed attic-window where she could stand and look out over the same
      drear landscape. It was only the ordinary midland succession of fields,
      now black with winter, and pastures through which the river ran, its
      course only indicated by the fringing line of pollards and willows. Away
      on the slope to the west rose a clump of trees from which peeped a few
      houses and a church spire, the little village of Wexwith. In the
      foreground ran the highroad skirted with new red-brick cottages, a touch
      of sordidness added by man to the ungenerous dreariness of nature. Once
      this had affected Clytie with a sense of the unutterable melancholy of
      things. The young are prone to be so affected. They are rather proud when
      they realise it; it is a kind of youthful vanity. But Clytie, like the
      wiser among us, sought brightness as she grew older, and although she
      could not consider the landscape cheerful, looked at it only through the
      memories of five years. Every spot had associations for her. There was the
      cottage where she had seen the little bully strike his playmate, the
      original conception of the picture that had helped to cause her welcome
      banishment from home. Next to it used to live the old beldame who threw
      out of doors the custards and jellies that Janet with angelic perseverance
      used to take her. What cruel mockery she used to make of Janet in those
      days! Now she submissively helped to carry the custards. Behind the
      swelling uplands over the village the sun set, a red ball in the wintry
      sky. For how many wild fantastic daubs had not that formed a background!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during these reveries that the picture subject she craved commenced
      to haunt her as it gradually shaped itself into definiteness. Since her
      singular interview with the French girl at Dinan a lurid gleam streamed
      from the gates ajar of mysteries that had baffled her. She had read widely
      and deeply; but books are only the gloss of life, they are not the text.
      Its secrets must be read in the living world, with much pain and
      sleeplessness and wearied eyes. The throbbing page had been presented to
      Clytie for one sharp moment, blazing, the while, in letters of flame. Such
      knowledge changes lingering girlhood into womanhood without the aid of
      passion. It changes sex-pride into sex-sorrow&mdash;in higher natures, be
      it understood. And this sex-sorrow runs in channels hollowed out by
      ever-varying circumstance and temperament. It flows in the patient,
      all-enduring devotion of the sister labouring among outcasts, in the
      militant enthusiasm of the social reformer. It quivers in the hearts of
      teachers like George Eliot and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. It lives in the
      souls of some mothers who tremulously watch the shaping of their
      daughter's destiny. With Clytie it ran confluent with her artistic
      impulses. It had influenced them vaguely, dimly, hauntingly for months,
      but now, at last, stirringly, proclaiming itself, insistently demanding
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was found: Faustina in her innocent maidenhood. The problem:
      how to manifest the foreshadowings of passion on the young, clear face?
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie spent hours in her attic trying to fix the summer lightnings of
      features that flashed elusively before her mind. She wished she were in
      London, to go abroad in the highways seeking after a face. It seemed to
      her that in the great city she would find the one she wanted, in the park,
      at the theatre, perhaps among the subdued black rows of women&mdash;lines
      of suppressed volcanic workings&mdash;in some great shop. But in Durdleham
      volcanoes were extinct or regulated by formula to erupt with mild
      propriety. She began to feel the frenzied weariness of helplessness. If
      only she could talk to someone&mdash;to Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Mrs. Blather came into the attic. Clytie was dreaming before
      incoherent charcoal streaks. The fire had burned low and the draught of
      the opening door made her shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Clytie, child, you are blue with cold,&rdquo; said her sister, wrapping
      her gray woollen shawl more tightly round her thin shoulders. &ldquo;Why do you
      mope up here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not moping, Gracie,&rdquo; replied Clytie; &ldquo;I am only working&mdash;conceiving
      a picture, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you oughtn't to do any work. Have you not come down for a
      holiday? What's the good of burning the candle at both ends? Come down to
      the drawing-room and talk to the Howatsons; they are inquiring after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am in such a mess!&rdquo; laughed Clytie, showing her blackened finger
      tips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come down and tidy yourself in my room; there is a fire, and you
      can warm yourself for a few minutes.&rdquo; Clytie followed her sister down the
      stairs to the latter's bedroom, where a cheerful fire warmed the cold
      clean chintz of the hangings. Mrs. Blather sat down by the hearth, while
      Clytie washed her hands and touched her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you tell us more of your work, Clytie?&rdquo; she said
      propitiatingly. &ldquo;Here you are being criticised in the newspapers, quite
      like a famous person, and we at home know nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Gracie, I thought it did not interest you much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would take an interest if you would only let us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you see, I paint such queer pictures. I don't think they are your
      style. And then pictures are not portable like books. If I wrote poetry,
      you could be deluged with presentation copies; but even we ourselves lose
      all the result of our work when the picture is sold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, but you might write and talk more. And with regard to the
      'queer' pictures, don't you think, if you made us your confidantes, the
      pictures might be a little less&mdash;'queer'? You see, Clytie, you are
      young, and it is your nature to run into extremes. If you were just a
      little bit restrained by older folks, would you not get what you are so
      fond of talking about&mdash;'truth'&mdash;in your work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie was somewhat puzzled at Mrs. Blather's conciliatory tone. Was this
      an effort towards a better understanding, or was it a disguised lecture?
      She finished her hasty toilet and went and stood by the fire near her
      sister, her foot on the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you very much, Gracie,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but would you always understand?
      Perhaps,&rdquo; she added, smiling, after a pause, &ldquo;you would want to restrain
      too much&mdash;and where would the picture be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why not try? What is the picture to be about that you are working
      at now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blood rushed to Clytie's cheeks, which, bent down, caught the added
      glow of the fire&mdash;a contrast, with her rich colour, to the clear,
      waxen, negative face of her sister. She broke suddenly into a nervous
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Even from the beginning I couldn't discuss it with you, Gracie. It
      is only a girl's face&mdash;I can't tell you anything more about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's what I complain of,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blather with growing acidity.
      &ldquo;You keep your own sisters in ignorance of your life, and confide
      everything to this Mr. Kent, who is nothing to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know I have told Mr. Kent about this picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not referring to this one, though by your manner I see you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, I have,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;because&mdash;because&mdash;he has the
      artistic temperament&mdash;and he can seize an idea&mdash;in fact&mdash;why
      are you saying this to me, Gracie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are not going the right way, Clytie; and it is my duty as
      your elder sister, who has looked after you since you were so high, to
      make a last effort to bring you within some restraining influences. We
      don't like your intimacy with Mr. Kent. It is not what we have been taught
      to think right. I know you look down upon us as narrow-minded at
      Durdleham. I think it is better for us. We are shut in, perhaps, between
      high walls, but the high walls keep us safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a few moments, then Clytie said: &ldquo;Gracie, don't you
      think this subject has been enough discussed? It is wasting words and
      spoiling good intentions. Suppose we go down to the Howatsons.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne day, about this
      time, Kent was walking home from the Museum. His spirits had by no means
      lightened since his conversation with Wither, and he strode along moodily,
      trying to fix his attention on the arrangement of that evening's portion
      of the great work. He had gone back to it resolutely and doggedly, and was
      conscious that it was progressing not badly, but at the same time he had a
      troubling sense that he was treating it less as an aim than as a cure for
      existence. Fairfax, the doctor, told him he was overdoing himself, that
      the strain of double work was telling, advised total idleness, and if
      possible a change of air. Kent gave the prescription a trial, and went
      down to the Isle of Wight for a week-end, where he tramped himself utterly
      tired during the day and bored himself exquisitely during the evening.
      Then he came back rather worse than when he went. No; he was suffering
      from change, and not from the want of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      London was in a pitiable condition. It had snowed, then thawed into slush,
      and now a hard black frost had set in, rendering the roadways like glass.
      Already during his walk home Kent had seen four horses down. On the first
      two occasions he had lent a helping hand. After that it began to grow
      monotonous, and he hurried past the accidents, anxious to get home out of
      the sullen iron-bound streets. At the corner of Sloane Square and the
      King's Road he saw a familiar girlish figure coming towards him. It was
      Winifred, her dark cheeks glowing with the exercise of walking; but he
      noticed a look of trouble in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad to have met you, Mr. Kent,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I want to speak to
      you. Can you walk a little way with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, as long as you like. What is the matter? You are not
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I have been upset, so upset; you would hardly think it. Come and I
      will tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the road and went on down Lower Sloane Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about Jack&mdash;Jack, the model, you remember. He has been run
      over! Oh, it's horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are going to him?&rdquo; asked Kent, noticing for the first time a
      little basket hanging over her arm. &ldquo;Give me that,&rdquo; he added, taking the
      basket, which she out of habit surrendered to him. &ldquo;And these are jellies
      and what not for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Will you come with me and see him, see what can be done for him,
      rather? His mother is so harsh, so stupid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come to hear of the accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred's cheek paled a little and she turned her head from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it myself. Oh, I shall never, never forget it! just outside Sloane
      Square station; I was coming home, yesterday. The ground was just as
      slippery as it is now. Oh, how can I tell you! It makes me shudder to
      think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; said Kent good-naturedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a few steps. Then, nerving herself, she went on with
      more coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was just in front of me when I came out, and as he saw me he ran away,
      frightened&mdash;like a little scared animal; you know his ways. And
      crossing the road, not looking where he was going, he turned his head
      round as if to see I was not following him, and then he slipped&mdash;oh-h!
      under the hoofs of a horse&mdash;in a hansom. And the driver tried to pull
      up sharp, and the horse came down too&mdash;on top of Jack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A crowd at once collected. I rushed through&mdash;I must have screamed a
      little and cried that I knew him, for the people made way for me. It all
      seemed like a horrid dream. I can't tell what happened, except that I
      found myself kneeling on the ground with the poor little mite's head on my
      lap. Then someone was talking to me, who said he was a doctor, and began
      to examine the boy's injuries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he badly hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor does not know yet. No bones are broken&mdash;the injuries are
      internal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he at the hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. At his own home. I gave them the address, and told them his mother
      would care for him&mdash;why, I don't know. And then they got a stretcher
      from the police-station and carried him home, and I went with them and
      broke it to his mother. But, oh! Mr. Kent, almost the most awful part of
      it is that it seems as if I was the cause of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear child,&rdquo; said Kent in rough earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, it is. If it hadn't been for me he would not have run across the
      road in a fright. Oh! I can see it now&mdash;the horse plunging, his hoofs
      over the child&mdash;and then the collapse, and the child hidden under the
      horse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They turned down a side street and then another, sinking into the squalour
      that still remains in that vague river district between Pimlico Pier and
      Milbank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little chap! Punishment has come at last,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;It has a kind
      of way of doing so. What does Clytie think of it? Have you told her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wrote to her yesterday. This morning I got a telegram. I think I
      have it with me. It is Clytie all over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the purse she was carrying inside her muff and drew from it a
      crumpled telegram. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreadfully distressed. Get the best of everything, nurse, doctor. Find
      money to go on with in drawer at once. I must feel that I am doing
      something. Will write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is like her,&rdquo; said Kent, with a smile, as he handed it back to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder whether you would mind doing something for me, Mr. Kent?&rdquo; said
      Winnie after a pause. &ldquo;Get the money out of Clytie's drawer for me. I have
      been so busy all day. Reggie is in bed with a bad cold and the house is
      upside down&mdash;and of course I have to come here. You see, I must use
      the money, or else Clytie would be hurt; it seems to me to be a matter of
      conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or a matter of Clytie's telling you?&rdquo; said Kent.
</p>
    <p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps it's
      that. One always does what Clytie says. So do you, Mr. Kent. Anyhow, I
      should like to have the money for the sake of obeying her wishes. Could
      you get it for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, if you will tell me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's easy. I have the key of her secretaire in my purse. She keeps
      her cash-box there. You can let me have it as it is. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I will bring it round to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The early winter twilight had fallen and scared shivering indoors the
      brood of unwashed children that possess these gray, sordid streets. Here
      and there women stood at the doors, their hands folded in their aprons,
      with little ones clinging to their skirts, chaffering with a costermonger,
      or exchanging shrill confidences with a neighbour. Most of the front
      parlours on the ground floor were lightless, with drawn blinds. Here and
      there a public-house beer-can gleamed white upon the railing spikes.
      Workmen lurched heavily along, now and then followed by shawled,
      bare-armed wives, vituperative. For it was Saturday afternoon, when the
      businesslike wife looks after her husband. Here and there from a suddenly
      opened doorway came the smell of many weeks' cooking. The poorer classes
      despise fresh air in their rooms&mdash;perhaps because they get it for
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred stopped with Kent at a dark-fronted, dingy house, the facsimile
      of the forty other houses in the dingy row and of the forty opposite
      across the narrow roadway. A little girl answered her knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Burmester in, my dear? Come, Mr. Kent, if you don't mind. I know the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent followed her up two flights of stairs, and into Mrs. Burmester's
      room. It was less squalid than he had imagined. A fire was burning in the
      grate, with a saucepan simmering. There were fairly substantial chairs, a
      table, and the ragged remains of a carpet. On a big bed by the side of the
      wall, not uncomfortable-looking nor unclean, lay Jack, tossing his wild
      elf head in delirium. By the side of the bed sat a nurse, whom the doctor
      had sent. Mrs. Burmester was spreading out the tea-things on the table.
      Her red, heavy face brightened momentarily when Winnie entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is he now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mortal bad, miss. He hasn't had his senses all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the doctor&mdash;does he say anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he would like a consultation,&rdquo; replied the nurse, &ldquo;but he did not
      know exactly whom to refer to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, to me, of course!&rdquo; replied Winnie. &ldquo;He knows my name and address. If
      you see him before I do, say I authorise him to do anything he thinks
      right. We are willing to&mdash;that is, he need not be hindered by
      questions of expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winnie turned to Mrs. Burmester with the basket, which she had taken from
      Kent's hand. The mother thanked her, almost monosyllabically. She was too
      dull for emotions of any kind. Kent watched her with interest, for Clytie
      had often spoken of her, hinting at her own puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lull in Jack's ravings as Winifred and Kent stood over the bed
      looking at him. The expression of sullen ferocity had gone from his face,
      which now seemed refined and gentle. He smiled at Winifred, not
      recognising her, murmured something incoherent about arithmetic. His mind
      had wandered back to his earlier school-days. He had been fond of a
      teacher there, his mother explained. Her name was Miss Jones. She wished
      he was fond of anybody now. He was a sore trial to her. The floodgates of
      dull speech were opened and a slow stream of joyless anecdote poured forth&mdash;a
      jeremiad of Jack's iniquities. Winnie stopped her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must not think of that now, Mrs. Burmester,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have to get
      him round again; and then we will see whether we can't make a good boy of
      him for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You won't do that. He is too much like his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stayed a little longer, talking. Then they went, as Winifred had to
      be back among her own family responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Kent as they were walking homewards, &ldquo;this must be
      Treherne's parish&mdash;in fact, I am sure of it. Has it not struck you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it never occurred to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he ought to know. I'll send him a line. He knows all about this
      sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked with her as far as the door of her own house. There she gave him
      the key of Clytie's secretaire. Mrs. Gurkins kept the room key. He left
      her and turned homewards, striding along rather fast, eager to execute
      Clytie's commission. He was filled with a foolish pleasure at her
      impulsive telegram; touched also at Winifred's implicit obedience and
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a queen among women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The silly phrase passed through his mind and he caught himself repeating
      it with his lips, half aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; he added with some impatience. And he stopped to look in at a
      shop-window to divert his mind. It was a boot-shop. He ran his eye
      mechanically over the rows of commonplace, cheap boots, and then it fell
      upon a little pair of tan shoes, with broad silk laces. Before he realised
      how his mind was working, a picture rose before him of Clytie wearing a
      similar pair during the summer trip abroad. He remembered bending down one
      day when a knot had slipped and retying it for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am becoming a positive ass!&rdquo; he said to himself, with an angry jerk
      away from the window. Then he redoubled his pace, as if in defiance, but
      the silly phrase rang in his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a queen among women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obtained the key from Mrs. Gurkins, and entered the tenantless room.
      The blinds were down, the curtains undrawn. It was just dark. He lit the
      piano candles and looked about him. How dreary the room seemed! The
      fireless grate, the coverless table (the cloth had been thriftily put away
      by Mrs. Gurkins), the absence of the feminine litter with which Clytie was
      wont to strew the room&mdash;all made his heart sink for a moment beneath
      the weight of a great longing. He remembered, too, the room by that dim
      light&mdash;on the evening of Clytie's submission. He saw her again lift
      her arms to unpin her hat from behind, the proud young figure standing out
      free as she looked at him half playfully, half seriously, her ripe, full
      lips parted in a smile. His breath came quickly as a flood of
      self-knowledge swept over him. He had felt puzzled then&mdash;at vague
      inarticulate desires. Now they were gathering a terribly real, objective
      shape. He grew dizzy, hot and cold, half terrified at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      With shaking fingers he fitted the key in the lock of the secretaire. In
      the drawer was a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends&mdash;letters,
      keys, ball-programmes, receipted bills&mdash;which he had to thrust aside
      so as to withdraw the little japanned cash-box. As he lifted it out a
      handkerchief came with it, caught by its lace edge, and after dangling a
      little fell at his feet. He picked it up, kept it in his hand, soothed at
      the softness. A faint odour of perfume rose from it, subtle and delicate&mdash;the
      well-known perfume that Clytie always used. It was like an emanation from
      herself. It grew over his highly strung senses like a breath of her own
      personality, sweet, intoxicating, overpowering. His brain swam. With a
      kind of groan he staggered to the sofa, threw himself upon it, burying his
      face in the little handkerchief, kissing it madly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all was clear, waves of lightning flashing the truth through him. He
      loved her, passionately, desired her with a passion all the fiercer for
      its long restraint. Yet he could not think coherently. One thought, one
      utter realisation, overpowered all others. At last this great surging
      sex-tumult was sweeping through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, I love her! Oh, my God, I love her!&rdquo; That was all that he
      could groan out as he lay upon the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creak of the door made him start up. On the threshold stood one of
      Mrs. Gurkins's curly-headed little children. She looked for a moment,
      rather frightened, at his haggard face, and then ran away. Thus aroused to
      a sense of external things, he locked up the secretaire and went out,
      taking the cash-box and handkerchief with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the slab outside his rooms he found a letter in Clytie's familiar
      handwriting. He went into his room, and sitting down before his writing
      space, spread the letter out before him. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Friend Kent:
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask me why I have not written to you for such a long time, I must
      shrink within my shell of femininity and refuse to give you reasons. For I
      have them, and they are compounded from a recipe handed down from Mother
      Eve. Well, I write to you now because I must. That reason I make you a
      present of.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to be in town again, in the King's Road, and to see you by the
      fireside, ready to be asked questions and to answer them, and to comfort
      your erratic friend Clytie with your kindliness and wisdom. She is looked
      upon as a bad girl here, and pines for someone who thinks her human, and
      who also thinks her art human, and can help her in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listen, now; I have got <i>the</i> subject at last; it is eating my heart
      out almost, I have to keep it hidden so to myself. I must tell you&mdash;for
      the sake's sake. &ldquo;Faustina as a young, innocent girl, with the
      foreshadowings of passion on her face.&rdquo; There! Now you know. What do you
      think of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember my depression at Dinan? Well, I think it was there I got
      the conception. I can't tell you more. But it is haunting me. I feel what
      I want to do, but I can't get a face. What shall I do? Tell me. You know,
      dear Kent, in our talks, we have often disregarded principles that move
      the world pretty potently. But as an artist I am bound to recognise the
      part that passion plays in the tragedy of things.

      can I ever do anything for you? You must tell me, dear friend, when the
      time comes.

    <p>
      I should like to tell you to give Winnie a kiss for me, but that is
      idiotic, isn't it? Yet you know what I mean. See that the dear child is

    <h3>
      C. D.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Kent took some time to read this. The letters swam a little before his
      eyes. Then he laid his head upon his arms and thought, in dumb agony.
      Clytie's letter, sisterly and trustful, soothed and goaded him at once.
      &ldquo;The part that passion plays in the tragedy of things!&rdquo; God! Had a
      fleeting thought never struck her what a part it might play in their
      lives' tragedy? How could he answer that letter, addressed to a friend,
      received by a lover in the hot flush of newly awakened realisation? How
      could he meet her bright, frank look with this burning demon within him?
      It was base, horrible. His mind wandered to a German print he had seen
      somewhere, a goat-footed satyr kneeling and leering at Psyche. He
      shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is given but to few men to know this terror of love: only to those who,
      like Kent, have hitherto expended vast animal and moral energies in
      non-sexual enthusiasms, and have rebelled with almost passionate repulsion
      against the assertion of the sexual principle. To some men love dawns like
      a sweet, fair star&mdash;the storm comes later on. To such as Kent it
      comes in terrific forked lightnings and crash of thunder, overwhelming the
      soul with terror. To Kent's excited fancy it seemed that the Beast, such
      as Wither had spoken of, had entered into him. He had betrayed the compact
      of friendship, her sisterly trust in him. Fool that he had been! Why had
      he not recognised it before? Now all was over between them. The future
      seemed nothing but black, rolling darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitary gas-jet that he had lit on entering flared high and strident
      over the mantelpiece above the blackening fire, and Kent lay with his
      hands on his arms, his morbid brain at death-grapple with love, he himself
      heedful of nothing external&mdash;not even of a gay whistle and a quick,
      springing tread on the uncarpeted stairs. The door burst suddenly open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come out, you fusty old hermit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Wither stopped. Kent raised a drawn, rather ghastly face and stared
      at him stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear old chap, in the name of Heaven, what's the matter?&rdquo; cried
      Wither, putting down his hat and stick and coming towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo; said Kent, who pulled himself together with an effort,
      rose, and broke into a forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wither looked at him steadily while he slowly drew off his gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nonsense!&rdquo; he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his sharp glance fell on the little crumpled handkerchief that lay
      beside the open letter on the table. His quick sense, aided by certain
      opinions he had formed long since, grasped the main feature of the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went over to where Kent was standing by the fireplace, and laid his
      hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, dear old man, it will all come right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will never come right,&rdquo; groaned Kent absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must. She must care for you in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know what I am thinking of?&rdquo; Kent burst out rather fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guessed. Besides&mdash;the handkerchief. It is not your own. Yours are
      a little more businesslike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; said Kent a little huskily, and throwing his head back with a
      gesture of impatience, &ldquo;I can't hide it. What would be the good? I have
      found out that she is a friend no longer, that what you were saying the
      other night is true&mdash;and I feel a brute! My God, what a brute I
      feel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither's mental balance was for a moment upset. He righted it after a
      moment with considerations of his friend's character. In many fragile,
      nervous bodies there is a delicacy of perception which often remains all
      the keener when protected by a shell of cynicism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to be reasoned with gently, friend John,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must not
      feel a brute when you love a woman as a man like you can love. It's the
      best and holiest thing on God's earth, believe me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Teddy, she is so frank, so trustful, so proud of our friendship&mdash;it
      can never be the same again&mdash;if I should tell her, she would hate me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can bet your life she wouldn't!&rdquo; murmured Wither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would go out of my life in indignation, and she would be right,&rdquo; Kent
      went on. &ldquo;She would scorn me for the feelings that I know now I have had
      all along for 'her. No; it is all over, all over. I can't meet her again.
      I think I shall go mad! I shall throw up everything and go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear, foolish old chap,&rdquo; said Wither, &ldquo;can't you see that very little
      would make her in love with you, if she is not so already? Why should you
      two not get married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marry!&rdquo; gasped Kent, as if struck by a new idea. &ldquo;I ask Clytie
      Davenant, with her beauty and intellect and genius, to come and share&mdash;this!
      Clytie Davenant marry me! Why, the idea is ludicrous&mdash;preposterous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were she, I should not think so,&rdquo; said Wither affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent shook his head gloomily, and kicked the smouldering coal into a
      fitful blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Until she shows me unmistakably&mdash;which can be never&mdash;that
      she cares for me in that way, I would sooner bite my tongue out than tell
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until she asks you to marry her, in fact! John Kent, you are two years
      older than I am, and three times as big. But verily you are a little
      child! And if you weren't,&rdquo; he added impulsively, with a soft glitter in
      his elfin eyes, &ldquo;you would not be the lovable old chap that you are!
      Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stay a little, Teddy!&rdquo; cried Kent. &ldquo;I'm not much company, but I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come round with me and have some dinner, then,&rdquo; interrupted Wither. &ldquo;It
      will occupy your body&mdash;if not your mind. And it will be better for
      you than the bottled beer and sardines which you usually feast upon. I
      shall be quite alone and you can do some work for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; replied Kent dejectedly. &ldquo;It does not matter what I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither turned his face to the fire, while Kent prepared to go out. When he
      turned round Kent was holding the cash-box in his hand. The handkerchief
      and letter were gone from the table, and Wither smiled inwardly. He had
      himself disposed of many such trifles in a similar way. Men are very much
      alike in several matters.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he atmosphere of
      Durdleham was uninspiring. Clytie could make no progress with her picture,
      and at last she laid it aside in despair. She had set her heart upon
      painting it, and the thoughts of it worried her, prevented her from
      sleeping. Not only would it give her fame, satisfy her ambition,
      stimulated by the success of &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; but it would satisfy certain cravings
      of her soul. And yet she was conscious that only when these cravings found
      articulate utterance could the haunting shadows be fixed. The lack,
      therefore, seemed to lie in herself: whether in her spiritual nature or in
      her material experience of the world she could not tell; perhaps it was a
      subtle combination of the two. She could not bring her lens of
      introspection to a focus. What she saw through it was blurred and
      inchoate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had looked forward to Kent's reply to her letter. His sympathetic
      common sense might help her. When his answer did come, after some days'
      interval, it was strangely cold and dispiriting, just two sides of
      note-paper barely filled with sententious enigma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the painting of it will bring you joy, paint. If not, you are grasping
      at shadows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the gist of it. What did it mean? Clytie was inclined to be
      indignant. Her own letter had been written out of the friendliness and
      needs of her heart, and the reply seemed almost like a rebuff. She did not
      know that the writing of it had caused Kent two hours' perplexed
      wretchedness. Even the finest feminine perception cannot pierce through a
      millstone. The little feeling of resentment towards Kent took the keenness
      of edge from her anticipated pleasure of seeing him again; at least so she
      told herself when she packed her boxes at the end of her visit to
      Durdleham. But as the train brought her nearer to London her spirits rose.
      She was free once more to live her own life, without fear of comment or
      criticism. It was simple, laborious, and innocent enough, and she desired
      little more at present; but there was the exhilarating sense of freedom,
      of perfect liberty to be outrageous, reckless, if such was her good
      pleasure, wherein lies much of the sweetness of independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found her sitting-room tidied, neatly arranged, looking as nearly as
      possible as if it had never been vacated, and Winifred, a transforming
      fairy in the midst of it, eagerly awaiting her. Clytie sighed a little as
      she listened to Winnie's gossip. The latter looked at her with reproachful
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only thinking, dear, that this is more my home than the house at
      Durdleham, and you are dearer to me than anyone there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred stroked her friend's hand in girlish fashion and turned away her
      head. She knew Clytie too well to make any reply. Then she spoke of Jack,
      who was in a fair way towards recovery. She had been very glad of Clytie's
      money, she confessed, with a deep blush, because things at home&mdash;well,
      Clytie knew. And Mr. Treherne, with whom Kent had communicated, had been
      very kind and helpful. He went round to Mrs. Burmester's every afternoon
      to cheer up the invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you go round pretty often?&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;every afternoon,&rdquo; replied Winifred simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Clytie, as she smoothed the shapely head lying in her lap, smiled to
      herself a little mysterious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kent, too, Winifred continued, had been invaluable to her. He had
      brought the boy picture-books, toys&mdash;had sat up with him one night
      whilst the nurse rested, the mother being quite helpless, and sleeping in
      an adjoining room which they had rented for the time between them. Never
      had street arab been so petted, so preciously guarded. He was growing
      quite human under the treatment. Kent and Treherne had managed to get him
      a nomination to a decent school-home, which would assure him an honest
      career in after life. Winifred was enthusiastic. She had never known
      before what a good, beautiful world it was, how filled with good and
      beautiful people!
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to a question of Clytie's she said that she had seen little of
      Kent lately; that he looked overworked, worried, on the rare occasions
      when she had exchanged a few words with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is doing too much. I must speak to him about it this evening,&rdquo; said
      Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it for granted that he would come, if not at the present hour,
      while they were sitting over the teacups, at any rate after dinner, to
      discuss in cheery, familiar fashion the events of the past month. But the
      moments slipped by and his footstep was not heard on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure that he knew I was coming back to-day?&rdquo; asked Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. He inquired twice of me,&rdquo; replied Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winnie went away, and Clytie dined, took up a book, and waited. But Kent
      did not come. Clytie felt hurt. If he had been engaged, he might at least
      have left her a word of welcome. It was unfriendly, unlike him. Surely she
      could not have offended him in any way. She grew interested in her book,
      sat up till a late hour finishing it. As she neared the end she heard the
      well-known footstep coming up the stairs. She laid her book down,
      expecting to see the door open, but though she thought she detected a
      faint pause outside on the landing, the sound of the tread did not cease,
      but continued up the next flight until it was lost. Then she went to bed,
      somewhat angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in her studio betimes in the morning setting things straight.
      Orders had come in for a couple of small street-urchin pictures. She had
      to make arrangements for setting to work upon them at once. Her mind was
      intent upon the matter when she heard Kent pass down the stairs on his way
      to the Museum. Ordinarily he was accustomed, if he was not pressed for
      time, to thrust his head in at the studio door as he passed, nod
      good-morning, and perhaps receive some small commission to execute at the
      colour man's in Oxford Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has grown tired of our intimacy,&rdquo; thought Clytie, &ldquo;and is
      taking this opportunity of breaking it off.&rdquo; The thought was a whip to her
      pride. It sent the blood rushing in fierce waves to her cheeks. She was
      alone, an angry woman, not fit company for herself. She felt humiliated,
      insulted, and encouraged herself in the feeling, baring her shoulders to
      the lash. It scarcely occurred to her then to inquire into the justice of
      the suggestion&mdash;the mere fact of the suggestion presenting itself was
      sufficient to make her burn with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After lunch she took a cab and drove to Piccadilly to look at the shops
      and the people. Town was filling again, the afternoon sun shone brightly.
      Clytie's spirits rose. She went with light, defiant tread down the
      Burlington Arcade, flashing a contemptuous glance upon admiring loungers,
      bought herself gloves and odds and ends of millinery, crossed over to Bond
      Street, looked in at Dowdeswell's to see a picture on view in the gallery,
      and then, after an interview with Burrowes, the dealer, in Oxford Street,
      she turned into Regent Street, prepared to enjoy the contemplation of the
      miscellaneous crowd forever moving up and down its broad pavement. Perhaps
      the wished-for face would meet her there, she thought, smiling to herself;
      in which case she determined that she would stop, pass it and repass it,
      fixing its features in her memory. She amused herself thus for some time,
      scanning the faces of the passers-by, inventing rapid histories to
      account, here for the after-light of laughter in a young girl's eyes, and
      there for the lines of pain round the corners of an older woman's lips.
      She paused before a shop-window to observe a ragged little arab who was
      flattening a nose, already much snubbed by previous applications, against
      the glass. To gratify a whimsical artistic fancy she entered the shop on a
      trivial pretext so as to obtain from the other side of the pane the aspect
      of the urchin's face. Then, after making a mental note of it for future
      use, she went on her way. It was exhilarating, this bright London, with
      its manifold variegation, after the dull uniformity of Durdleham. This
      perpetual stimulus was necessary to her art, which drooped helpless in the
      quiet country town. And with the thrill of artistic quickening came the
      buoyant, vigorous pulsation of youth. Her tread was elastic, her cheeks
      and eyes animated. She had forgotten her irritation of the morning in the
      sense of vitality and enjoyment. It was a good thing to be young, with a
      purpose in life and the freedom and strength to carry it out. Clytie
      tasted a rare happiness that afternoon, one of which the high gods are
      very sparing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt a touch on her arm, and a voice exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Clytie! What are you wandering about here for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned round. The speaker was Mrs. Farquharson, merry and smiling.
      They shook hands and walked leisurely down the street together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you get away from that dreadful place, and why haven't you been
      to see us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my first day of freedom,&rdquo; replied Clytie, &ldquo;and I was just
      thinking of coming round to Harley Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right! You will come round with me when I have finished my
      shopping. I was wishing for you. I have a little&mdash;no, a big treat for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it nice to eat? I looked in longingly at Charbonnel's as I passed
      down Bond Street, and I am hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Thornton&mdash;at last,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson with a little air of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie was interested, and forgot Charbonnel's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did he come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been in England some weeks, but only a few days in London. Do you
      know, he is going to settle down. Won't that be delightful? I do hope you
      will like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is going to give up fighting and exploring and all that?&rdquo; asked
      Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he says. But I don't believe it. He will get seized with the fever
      after a time and then off he will go again. That has always been his way.
      But at any rate we will have him with us for a season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he staying with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! We wanted him to, but he is too wild a creature. Besides,
      he knows the half of London, and is in demand everywhere. He is quite a
      personage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where does the treat come in?&rdquo; asked Clytie, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he comes to Harley Street this afternoon for tea, you obtuse girl,&rdquo;
       cried Mrs. Farquharson. &ldquo;And that is why we had better make haste to get
      back, as it is growing late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie had often heard Mrs. Farquharson speak of this cousin, Thornton
      Hammerdyke, and was half doubtful whether to allow herself to be infected
      with her enthusiasm or to prepare herself to find him commonplace, as one
      generally does find the particular heroes of our intimate friends.
      Caroline was never tired of talking of him. He was a hero, a latter-day
      berserker. She was proud of him, treasured up paragraphs in the newspapers
      in which his name was mentioned, wove a woman's web of romance around his
      brilliant exploits. She had often waxed eloquent over his fame, his
      personal charm, his physical strength and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all this can't be contained in one poor mortal,&rdquo; Clytie would say
      sometimes, teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Farquharson would reply, without any of the banter that generally
      characterised her personal gossip:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait until you have seen him, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the imaginative there was much that was heroic and romantic in the
      record of the active life of Thornton Hammerdyke. He had entered the army
      shortly after leaving school, but, wearying after a couple of years of the
      dulness of a garrison life, had resigned his commission. An exploring
      party to Thibet was afoot. He joined it, quickly became its leading
      spirit, and when the chief of the expedition was incapacitated through
      illness he undertook the command. This brought him into public notice.
      When the Soudan War broke out he joined Lord Wolseley as a volunteer, and
      made himself conspicuous by his daring and his marvellous feats of bodily
      strength. His name was known all through the army. He courted danger,
      especially where it took the form of hand to hand fighting. An eye-witness
      of the scene had told Caroline how once, when attacked by three gigantic
      Soudanese, he had shorn one clean through the body, lost his sword, leaped
      from his horse, wrenched the spear from one of the others with a force
      that made the man's arm snap like a twig, turn on the other&mdash;while
      the broken-armed savage leaped upon his back and tried to throttle him&mdash;and
      how before there was time to follow his movements both were lying dead at
      his feet. He had fought side by side with Burnaby in the rash conflict
      when the author of the &ldquo;Ride to Khiva&rdquo; fell pierced with Soudanese spears.
      He had been in evidence in every skirmish. When the war was over he
      remained in Africa, on the Soudan frontier, in command of some Egyptian
      cavalry, maintaining a guerrilla warfare until the troops were recalled.
      And then he plunged into the interior, exploring on his own account, with
      a nominal authority from the Belgian government. And it was on this part
      of his career that his reputation chiefly rested. Certainly ugly stories
      against him of undue harshness, even ferocity, were afloat at one time.
      But he laughed at these rumours on his return to England, and
      sarcastically observed in a letter to the <i>Times</i> that, given a
      community consisting of a judge, a prisoner, and a hundred howling, savage
      maniacs, it was a matter of some difficulty to form an impartial jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mrs. Farquharson and Clytie arrived at Harley Street the short
      January day had nearly drawn to a close. In the drawing-room the gas had
      not been lighted, and by the dull glow of the fire objects were only dimly
      visible. Two men rose from either side of the hearth as the ladies
      entered. The long ungainly figure Clytie recognised as Mr. Farquharson,
      the other as Thornton Hammerdyke, from Caroline's description of his great
      powerful frame. His face she could not distinguish; only a large, finely
      shaped head, and white teeth gleaming under a heavy moustache as he
      exchanged laughing greetings with his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson performed the little ceremony of introduction. Then tea
      was brought in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse this outer darkness, Clytie,&rdquo; said Caroline. &ldquo;George
      thinks it soothing. You know his ways. You see what a poor woman has to
      put up with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with him,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;It is cosy, and it seems to sanction
      foolish gossip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear me gossip?&rdquo; asked Mr. Farquharson severely. &ldquo;I like it,
      Miss Davenant, because it induces a meditative frame of mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And slumber,&rdquo; murmured his wife as she dispensed the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk continued light and easy, on the topics of the day, the studios,
      Thornton's plans for the enjoyment of civilised life. He spoke brightly,
      in a deep, resonant voice, that of a man assured of himself and of the
      interest afforded to others by reference to his own doings. Although the
      subject was trivial, the others listened amusedly, carried away by the
      influence of a strong personality. Clytie glanced at him from time to
      time, trying to measure him, to sum him up in the instinctive feminine
      way. But he was sitting far back from the fire, in the gloom, and she
      could only gather a general impression of physical size and vitality. She
      was conscious too, that, as she was sitting with her face in the direct
      glow, she was visible to him, and that he was looking at her quietly as he
      smoked his cigarette and talked. She picked up a newspaper from a little
      table by her side, and held it before her face as a screen. His glance,
      which she felt rather than met, embarrassed her, she scarcely knew why.
      Gradually the talk drifted into a slight discussion between the two men.
      Mrs. Farquharson took advantage of it to draw her chair near to Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all this time I have scarcely asked you a question about yourself.
      Come, account to me for the six weeks you have been away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie dutifully went over the main incidents of her stay in Durdleham,
      making light, in her pleasure at being in London again, of the little
      wearinesses and depressions of the past. A faint cloud came over her
      gaiety when Mrs. Farquharson asked her suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Kent? What has become of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still alive,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, he has not been near us all the time you have been away. He
      has treated us very badly. You must scold him for me. What has he to say
      for himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I haven't seen him yet, and I have scarcely heard from him.
      I shall have to scold him on my own account,&rdquo; she added, brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's odd of him,&rdquo; said Caroline. &ldquo;You are such inseparables that I
      thought he would have been waiting for you with a bouquet in each hand
      when you entered the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie laughed at the idea of Kent waiting for her with Covent Garden
      tributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would just as soon think of him reading me a sonnet. But I did expect
      him to come down to tell me I had been wasting my time, and to draw out a
      scheme for the better occupation of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care that he has not gone and fallen in love with somebody whilst he
      has been left to his own devices,&rdquo; said Caroline teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you say such wicked things?&rdquo; cried Clytie. &ldquo;Of course he
      hasn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One never knows, my dear. Men are the most unreasonable beings in the
      world. With a woman, now, if you know just the least little bit about her,&mdash;it
      isn't everybody, of course, that does,&mdash;you can always tell what she
      is likely to do. But with a man&mdash;never. Do you think I know whether
      that husband of mine is going to be pleased with his dinner to-night? No,
      not one scrap. And Kent's a man&mdash;just like the rest of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you talking about Kent?&rdquo; interposed Mr. Farquharson. &ldquo;I saw him the
      other night at the meeting of the Numismatic Society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, now! How like a man! And you knew I wanted to know what had become
      of him. What had he to say for himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That most of the rude coins marked with the name of Alfred were in
      reality imitations made by the vikings during their periodical visits to
      this country. His remarks were very interesting, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thornton,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson in her blandest tones, &ldquo;would you be so
      very kind as to light the gas?&rdquo; Her husband chuckled to himself, and
      Hammerdyke rose to comply with her request. During the operation all the
      three mechanically watched his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he said, turning to face them, &ldquo;I think that is better; we shall
      be able to see one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the full blaze fell upon him Clytie could not repress a little feminine
      thrill of surprise. Seen in the vague darkness she had imagined him quite
      different. He seemed to spring out of it a perfect type of physical
      manhood. He bore with him an atmosphere of splendid animalism. The artist
      in Clytie, trained to detect beauties of limb and set and fall of muscle,
      scanned him for a second with involuntary admiration. Although he was
      dressed with a fashionable tailor's perfection of fit, which generally
      gives suave uniformity to strong and puny, his clothes could not conceal
      the evidences of a magnificent strength&mdash;deep chest, arms that seemed
      to fit tightly the coat-sleeves, broad, massive shoulders, thick, powerful
      neck. He held his head high, commandingly, which gave him the appearance
      of tallness, although he was not much above medium height. Shortcut brown
      hair, clinging close to his head in crisp waves, a broad forehead with two
      thick vertical veins, added to this impression of strength. In spite of
      his thirty-four years the blood showed beneath his bronzed skin, on which
      there were few lines. His features, although on a large scale, were saved
      from coarseness by regularity. His under jaw was slightly heavy, but in
      keeping with the massiveness of his limbs. His eyes were dark and
      lustrous, with a light burning in their depths; his teeth white and even.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Hammerdyke is fighting he is all eyes and teeth,&rdquo; was a saying that
      had come to Mrs. Farquharson's ears; she had repeated it long since to
      Clytie, who remembered it now as she beheld this hero of Caroline's for
      the first time. He was not fighting now, but laughing, talking with a
      certain daring charm of manner, almost boyish sometimes. The time passed
      quickly. When the little clock in the corner struck six Clytie rose in
      some confusion. She had promised to spend the evening with Winifred and
      the children. She took her leave hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later she was sitting in the Marchpanes' drawing-room, with the
      children clinging around her, a block of paper and a pencil, as usual, in
      her hand. And led away by a sudden fancy she drew pictures for them of the
      wild deeds that she had heard tell of Thornton Hammerdyke. This was quite
      a novelty to the children, who were accustomed to street arabs and
      grotesque caricatures. They were delighted, hung on her lap, demanded more
      pictures of soldiers and camels and a great man in a helmet killing
      savages. To satisfy them she had to draw extensively upon her imagination,
      sometimes upon theirs. Winifred's suggestions were scouted as being too
      mild. The final picture was a great triumph. It represented the same man
      in the helmet dancing upon a struggling heap of savages, transfixing one
      with a spear held in his left hand, whilst with a sword in his right he
      clove another in twain. Nothing is so fascinating to children as the
      grotesquely horrible; Clytie herself was carried away by their enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the subject of this picture history had remained at Harley
      Street for a short time after Clytie's departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that is the Clytie you used to write to me about in Africa?&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;No wonder you like having such a splendid thing about the place, as a
      kind of intermittent fixture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad you like her,&rdquo; said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say I liked her. I don't give myself away so soon as that. But,
      by Jove! I liked looking at her. Where is she generally to be found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Either here or, if you make yourself very civil to her, she may let you
      go round to her studio&mdash;on her day, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she runs a day, does she? These young women are getting very
      emancipated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are,&rdquo; said George Farquharson, lighting his pipe. &ldquo;So much the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know so much about that,&rdquo; replied Hammerdyke. &ldquo;If they are too
      emancipated, they get an idea that their own way is everything in the
      world, and grow devilish hard in the mouth when the time comes for them to
      be pulled up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a contradictory creature!&rdquo; cried Caroline. &ldquo;Only yesterday you were
      railing at the well brought up drawing-room young ladies you were having
      to take in to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so: the things that draw, recite, and play the fiddle, and
      rush about to lectures. I am getting a bit too old for that kind of young
      animal. I'd sooner spend a week with the wife of a camel driver than with
      any one of them. She would be just as intelligent, somewhat funnier, and
      the advantage would be that you could lick her into shape without alarming
      absurd prejudices. No; the drawing-room young lady is distinctly 'off,'
      just as much as the over-emancipated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what kind of a young woman are you looking out for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never look out for anything, my dear Caroline. I take what comes&mdash;if
      it pleases me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope Clytie will please you, Thornton. She is quite different from
      any other girl I know. And it's just her little airs of emancipation that
      give her charm, I wish there were more like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I, by Jove! There would be some pleasure in looking around a
      theatre or a ball-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet I should think that was rather a relief after Central Africa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton broke into a gay laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unsophisticated woman has her good points, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; said Farquharson, pulling at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They chatted for a little while longer. Then Hammerdyke pulled out his
      watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go and dress for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by the way, Thornton,&rdquo; said Caroline, &ldquo;did you not tell me you had an
      appointment at six? I hope we haven't kept you from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he replied cheerfully as he gathered up his hat and stick.
      &ldquo;It's only Field. I dare say he's waiting for me now. I shan't turn up at
      the club, though. He can rip. When he is tired of kicking his heels and
      drinking small whiskeys he can curse the waiter and go. I must be off now.
      Let me know when Clytie is on view again and I'll throw over anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson smiled indulgently. In her eyes there was no one like
      Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thornton is a bit of an egotist,&rdquo; said George mildly to his wife, later
      in the evening, when they were alone together. He was not addicted to the
      hyperbolic, like Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but, George, he is such a dear good fellow&mdash;and such a splendid
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Quem sese ore ferens! quam forti pectore et armis!'&rdquo; murmured her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now George Farquharson knew that if there was one thing his wife disliked
      it was that he should quote Latin at her. It generally occasioned a
      distraction. If it failed, he translated. The effects of that were
      certain. This time Mrs. Farquharson was content to allow his remark to
      remain &ldquo;veiled in the obscurity of a learned language.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> do wish you would
      cheer up, old chap,&rdquo; said Wither sympathetically. &ldquo;You are getting
      uncomfortable&mdash;like Mr. Mantalini's body, in the midst of our
      joyousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was lying curled up, as usual, on the sofa, smoking a cigarette. Kent
      was brooding over the fire. Fairfax had been rallying him from a doctor's
      point of view, and he had answered vaguely, striving not to let his
      friend's rough kindness jar too unbearably. He felt relieved when the
      doctor was called out to see a patient, and Wither and himself were left
      alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am making an ass of myself. I have never felt miserable
      before in all my life, and it must be that I am unused to it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gets in your way like a man's court-sword on the first time of
      wearing,&rdquo; said Wither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat,&rdquo; replied Kent, with a short laugh. He did not mind Wither's
      jesting. It came spontaneously from the small, bright-eyed man&mdash;was
      in fact his natural language. &ldquo;Perhaps it does. I'll get over it some
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right when she comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how are matters going between you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't seen her yet,&rdquo; said Kent moodily, staring into the fire. &ldquo;That
      is to say, I have seen her. I have lain in wait for her, so as to catch a
      glimpse of her as she passed by. But I have not met her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when do you propose going to see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows! I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether this is <i>fin de siècle</i> or whether it belongs
      to the glacial epoch,&rdquo; said Wither, drawing a breath of bewilderment. &ldquo;At
      any rate, has it never struck you, friend John, that being in love with a
      woman is no reason why you should be rude to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have scarcely thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, by Jove, the sooner you can get it into your muddled head, the
      better. What have you been doing with yourself these evenings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything to keep away. A meeting of the Geological, another of the
      Numismatic&mdash;a theatre, where there was just such another ass as
      myself. I couldn't stand it, so I went out and turned into the Empire and
      tried to find comfort in performing dogs. I have also dined out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been a cheerful lot. What did you say to your partner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. She wanted to babble on, and I let her babble. Curse the whole
      thing!&rdquo; he cried, smiting a block of coal with the poker, so hard that the
      chips flew over the hearthrug; &ldquo;To think that it should be my fate to meet
      the only woman in the whole world who doesn't babble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should consider it in the light of a privilege,&rdquo; said Wither.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, after a night's agony of indecision, he plucked up
      courage and tapped at the studio door. He entered. Clytie was alone,
      busily preparing her palette. She paused with the half-squeezed tube in
      her hand, and looked up at him without rising, her brows slightly knitted.
      He remained motionless, too, on the threshold, after mechanically shutting
      the door behind him. He tried to utter the little address of lame excuses
      which he had framed, but the words stuck, somehow, in his throat. He was
      only conscious that she was there, in the same room with him again,
      looking bewilderingly fresh and beautiful in her dark dress, with its
      dainty painting-apron, too simple almost for the rich colour of her eyes
      and hair and the stately bend of her neck. Yet even then he noticed she
      was a trifle paler than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to have come to see you before,&rdquo; he stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you? I rather expected you,&rdquo; she replied calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She finished squeezing her tube, and taking up her palette-knife, went on
      with her occupation. Kent, instinctively conscious that it is a
      disadvantage to stand, when morally wrong, before a sitting person who is
      in the right, drew Winifred's painting-stool away from the easel and sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have come in, if only for five minutes,&rdquo; said Clytie, as he made
      no reply. The hand holding the palette-knife trembled a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to,&rdquo; replied Kent, finding words with difficulty. &ldquo;But I
      couldn't. I am very, very sorry if I have been rude. I am always doing
      things of this sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not very pleasant for your friends; and I suppose we have been
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we have been friends,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and I hope we shall continue so&mdash;if
      you will forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice sounded strange in his own ears. In Clytie's it sounded cold and
      formal. She was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course I forgive you! You have made your apology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me&mdash;things have happened. I could not come before, indeed I
      could not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never doubted your word, Kent,&rdquo; said Clytie, with a touch of her old
      soft manner towards him. &ldquo;Only it seemed strange not to see you. One gets
      into a certain groove, and a change from it jars. You see how easy it is
      to become a Philistine. You are much more a child of the light than I am,
      in that you have got out of the groove quite easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to say that,&rdquo; said Kent, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps I have not,&rdquo; said Clytie, bending intently over her
      palette. &ldquo;Anyhow, the fact remains that we parted friends before
      Christmas, and now that I have come back you are changed. I am very sorry&mdash;sorrier
      than I can say. I have valued your friendship and the help it has given me&mdash;I
      am unchanged, I think so&mdash;and, to be franker than my sex generally
      is, I may say, I am hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent misunderstood. He could not help it. He thought she was grieved at
      his friendship having changed to love, which the tone in her voice told
      him could not be returned. All had happened just as he had anticipated.
      She spoke more in sorrow than in anger; that was the only difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would prefer that I did not see you again&mdash;or so often,&rdquo; he
      said, twisting the brim of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words estranged them still further. They were pathetic in their
      ludicrous inappositeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you must please yourself about,&rdquo; replied Clytie, with a quick flush.
      &ldquo;I have said all that my pride will let me say in the matter. If you
      prefer to break off our intercourse, well&mdash;so be it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that I don't wish to do that,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;Let me
      see you sometimes. Could I see you this evening, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I am sorry, I am going&mdash;I am dining out. Some other time. You
      know my hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forward and shook hands with her to say good-bye, thus breaking
      through an established custom between them of non-handshaking. He
      reflected on this a moment afterward. It seemed an omen of the dissolution
      of their friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone Clytie felt as if she would like to cry. What did it all
      mean? Why did Kent wish to break with her? She put down her palette and
      sat in her chair near the stove. She felt unhappy, lonely. She was in that
      strange state of uncertainty about the present, which often takes the
      form, with women especially in certain moods, of a presentiment of future
      trouble. &ldquo;I wish Winnie would come,&rdquo; she half repeated to herself. But
      almost on top of the thought entered one of Mrs. Gurkins's curly-haired
      children bringing her a note. It was from Winifred, who was suddenly
      called out of town on business and could not come on that day to the
      studio. Clytie mechanically tore up the note and scattered the pieces over
      the coals. She was not subject to fits of personal depression&mdash;independent
      entirely of the artistic side of her life. But the air seemed charged with
      disturbing, conflicting elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon she roused herself and went over to her easel, where for some time
      she worked steadily. A lay-figure clad in a child's ragged frock stood
      near by and she painted in the lights of the skirt, with mechanical
      precision of touch. But her thoughts were far away. Then the face that she
      had painted attracted her attention. It was that of a child&mdash;merry
      and smiling&mdash;but with the little London street girl's precocious
      wisdom. It was cleverly executed. Clytie had seized the suggestion of the
      everlasting feminine in the face, accentuating it ever so little. It
      seemed to laugh mockingly at her, out of the canvas, as who should say&mdash;&ldquo;Look
      at me. Child as I am, I am as old as the world, and I can tell you secrets
      that you know not of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wise little witch,&rdquo; said Clytie, after a while, standing back, with
      head inclined in critical surveyal of her work. &ldquo;I wish you could tell me
      what is the matter with Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then for the first time Mrs. Farquharson's idle, jesting words came
      into her mind:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care that he has not gone and fallen in love with somebody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the child's old face seemed to add a mocking confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This would explain all: his sudden change, the stiffness of his letter;
      his shrinking from seeing her; the awkwardness of his apology; the vague
      phrase, &ldquo;things have happened,&rdquo; which had puzzled her. The more she
      thought of it the more probable did this solution seem. It caused her a
      little heaviness of heart. Certain strange imaginings had come to her,
      too, this week. She needed the strength of Kent's friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no persons harder to read and easier to misunderstand than those
      of whom we are fondest. There are two common causes of mutual
      miscomprehension. First we take it too much for granted that we can read
      the heart of another human being; and secondly, we are too apt to conclude
      that affinities sharpen perception to such an extent that the unexpressed
      becomes luminously expressive. This is a curious fact, too little
      recognised in our minor problems in social statics. Clytie had fallen into
      the one error, Kent into the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life Clytie felt afraid. The sense of what was
      missing in her life dawned, half shadowy, before her. She was different
      from other girls of her age, more advanced, as the phrase goes. For the
      majority of women come in ignorance to emotion; they feel, before they
      realise that they are learning. But Clytie in her eager search after the
      roots of existence had learned much, with feelings as yet untried. In this
      knowledge, if as yet there was no sorrow, there was fear. If Kent had come
      to her at this moment with a passionate avowal of his love, she would have
      yielded to him. Her fear would have melted away into joyousness, the rich
      springs of her nature would have been opened, and her destiny would have
      been accomplished. But neither of them knew this. He was engaged in the
      humorous task of trying to kill love, and she was half consciously tending
      along a path strangely diverging from his.
    </p>
    <p>
      She dined that evening at the Farquharsons'. Hammerdyke was the only other
      guest. It was a bright, cosy meal, and Clytie soon forgot her depression
      of the morning. Caroline was at her merriest, proud of her three
      companions&mdash;of each in an especial manner. George was mildly
      satirical, as usual. He wore his velvet jacket, in which he found more
      happiness than in his ceremonial dress-coat. His dry touch of humour was
      pleasantly antagonistic to Hammerdyke's stronger personality and downright
      views of life. The latter laughed heartily, almost boyishly at his
      rebuker, like one who is accustomed to indulgence on the part of others
      for caprices of action and language. These, coming from a lesser man,
      might have been repugnant to the sensitive; but from him they seemed to
      bear a physical justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat opposite her, talking in off-hand, picturesque fashion of
      incidents in his adventurous life, Clytie could not help looking with a
      feeling somewhat akin to awe at the man who had gone through such things
      and could speak of them so lightly. She listened, interposed a question
      here and there, wondered what it would feel like to treat those memories
      in so familiar a fashion. A new page of life seemed to lie open before
      her, quivering with sensations beyond her ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you ever feel horribly afraid?&rdquo; asked Caroline, while he was
      sketching some of his more recent exploring experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so,&rdquo; he confessed frankly, &ldquo;but I had my devils well under control.
      I had the power to string a mutineer up on the nearest tree or to pot him
      with my revolver, and somehow they rather funked me. If it had entered
      their woolly heads to go for me all together they would have made short
      work of me&mdash;but no one liked to take the initiative.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever try kindness, on these expeditions&mdash;by way of
      experiment?&rdquo; asked Farquharson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much. You can't afford to fool away your life for the sake of an
      experiment. Oh, no! my dear sir, the noble savage does not swarm much
      round about the slave tracks in Central Africa. The Zulus may be
      different. I don't know&mdash;I've never seen much of them&mdash;but
      Fuzzywuz and his neighbours can only understand brute force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite see, now, how you got all that power,&rdquo; said Farquharson.
      &ldquo;Did you establish yourself as a little king&mdash;or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; returned Hammerdyke, laughing. &ldquo;When I had finished with the
      Soudan I wanted to while away a few months in the interior, and as the
      Belgians wanted a road made through the forest I offered to see things
      were done straight for them. As for the authority&mdash;judicial and that
      sort of thing&mdash;one takes that as a matter of course. The niggers
      don't know anything about it, except that there is a white man bossing
      them. They think it's all right, so what does it matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you hire a set of woolly-headed navvies, and if they lapse from your
      standard of virtue, you shoot them&mdash;is that the idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat. In mere slips one employs the <i>argumentum ad bacculinum</i>.
      It isn't pleasant, but it's the only way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going back again, are you, Thornton?&rdquo; Caroline asked, wishing
      to turn the conversation. She believed in Thornton, in his power by divine
      right to blow all the tribes of Central Africa from the cannon's mouth if
      it so pleased him, but she saw that George was not sympathetic. It was a
      sore little point with her that her husband did not share all her
      enthusiasm for Thornton. &ldquo;You are going to settle down now, really?&rdquo; she
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;All things become monotonous after a time&mdash;even
      playing potentate. That's why I am here&mdash;with the intention of giving
      civilisation a chance. Some fine morning I may wake up and think that it
      would be nice to have a little excitement, and then I may pack up my
      things and start for No Man's Land again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a stirring life,&rdquo; said Clytie half aloud, with a quick glance
      at Hammerdyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the best life. Action, excitement, keen enjoyment of everything!
      You should take a turn at it, George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But George shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a wife dependent upon me. Otherwise you may be sure I would leave
      this effete and effeminate civilisation and start to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you would do much good out there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Farquharson
      candidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They finished dinner early and went up to the drawing-room, which not long
      afterwards was filled with the heterogeneous crowd that the Farquharsons
      loved to gather round them. This reception was instead of the ordinary
      Sunday one, and was in Thornton's honour, although it was not unusual for
      Caroline thus to change her evening, scattering warning post-cards the day
      before. Kent, being on the list, had received one that morning, and before
      he saw Clytie had been half wondering whether he should go to Harley
      Street. So he had put his question as to Clytie's evening engagement
      tentatively. Her somewhat evasive reply had decided him. He would not
      inflict his society upon her. As Clytie's eye wandered over the familiar
      figures in the drawing-room, she involuntarily sought for Kent's. It seemed
      strange that he should not be there, for during the autumn he had scarcely
      missed a Sunday. One or two friends came up and asked after him. On the
      occasion of one inquiry, Mrs. Farquharson and Thornton were standing by
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Kent that everybody is talking about&mdash;if I may ask?&rdquo; said
      Hammerdyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent?&rdquo; interposed Caroline. &ldquo;Oh if you know Clytie, you must know Kent.
      They are a kind of Mentor and Egeria combination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's lucid,&rdquo; said Hammerdyke, laughing. &ldquo;I hope you will present me to
      him one of these days, Miss Davenant.&rdquo; Clytie replied with a commonplace,
      smiling absently. She was sad at heart about Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Redgrave, the R. A. who had given Clytie her first encouragement in
      her art, came up to talk with her. He had been following her career with
      some interest. Since the exhibition of &ldquo;Jack&rdquo; he had not seen her, and he
      took the opportunity of offering his congratulations, criticising the
      picture favourably. Then he inquired after its successor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't think you will ever become a great artist, if you keep to
      that semi-impressionist style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Being a portrait-painter of exquisite finish, Redgrave was prejudiced
      against the school of Degas. He mentioned his name with some acerbity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talking treason again, Redgrave?&rdquo; asked a thin, wiry man in gold
      spectacles, who had overheard. &ldquo;Don't listen to him, Miss Davenant. He is
      archaic and eating his soul out with jealousy. There's no one in England
      who can touch you in your particular line. You stick to it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quoting the rubbish you wrote in your paper, French,&rdquo; said
      Redgrave, laughing. &ldquo;Now, whom are you going to believe, this newspaper
      man or me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever will help me best to sell my pictures,&rdquo; laughed Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then leave your future with me,&rdquo; said Mr. French, rubbing his hands as he
      moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't mean that?&rdquo; asked Redgrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little. One must live. Higher art, to use the cant phrase, would
      satisfy one's soul's needs better&mdash;but it would not those of the
      body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Redgrave looked at her for a moment, as if meditating over her rich
      colouring and fine vitality. A body such as hers had its needs. He smiled
      a little sadly and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not sacrifice your life for your art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Clytie, with quick frankness, &ldquo;I wouldn't. The fuller one's
      life, the fuller one's art. The one is a reflection of the other. At least
      it is so with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll paint your portrait one of these days for nothing,&rdquo; said Redgrave
      somewhat irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie flushed a little at the compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to put into me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question whether even the most emancipated of young women ever has
      art in her soul,&rdquo; said Redgrave, with a quiet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to paint a picture some day that will astonish you,&rdquo; replied
      Clytie, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So is everyone. When will that some day be? I hardly know a painter
      or a writer or a musician that has not something he is going to do some
      day&mdash;a three-act drama all ready, bar transcription on paper&mdash;a
      masterpiece all complete, bar the mechanical transference to canvas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Redgrave, if you are going to moralise like that, I'll report you
      to Mr. Farquharson. You had much better sit down and take me round the
      studios.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Redgrave was carried off before he had time to begin, and Clytie
      joined a large group standing and sitting round the fire. They were the
      younger, less responsible members of the company, and were talking
      nonsense. Singleton, a clean-shaven, red-faced man and a minor poet, was
      explaining what he called the Physical Basis of Life. Professor Huxley, by
      the way, has treated the subject differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who cannot dine,&rdquo; Mr. Singleton was saying, &ldquo;cannot feel. He has
      not his proper equipment of senses. He is an imperfection, a waster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not apply to women, I hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tredegar, a languid,
      well-preserved woman, who was suspected of hankerings after a long defunct
      æstheticism. &ldquo;I have been feeling all my life&mdash;and I can't remember
      to have ever dined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did once&mdash;at the Café Anglais. By Jove, it was good!&rdquo; interpolated
      a fair-haired youth, who leaped eagerly at objectivities in the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your enthusiasm does you credit!&rdquo; said Singleton. &ldquo;You'll die yet, of a
      hopeless passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning to Mrs. Tredegar:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it applies to women. <i>La femme qui dîne, aime</i>. Put it
      into French, and you see the force of it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but if you put it the other way about. <i>La femme qui aime</i>&mdash;&mdash;It
      is horrible; it takes all the romance away,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tredegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; sighed Mr. Singleton, clasping his little plump hands
      resignedly. &ldquo;Are we still to adore the well-conducted person who goes on
      cutting bread and butter? Oh, believe me, Edwin Smith and Angelina Brown
      can't love, any more than they can appreciate Château-Mouton. They possess
      for each other a faint current of sexual attraction, which produces
      between them a mild excess of amiability. A lot of vanity comes in, as
      they like to parade the possession of each other before the envious. They
      call themselves lovers, and follow the traditions they have been taught in
      the novels they have misunderstood and the hints they have received from
      observance of their friends. The furthest they can go is to clasp hands
      limply under a sofa-cushion, when they think no one is looking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's humbug,&rdquo; said the youth. &ldquo;I have been in love myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Mr. Singleton, &ldquo;and you know nothing at all about it.
      Cultivate all your senses first, my young friend, and then you may fit
      yourself for falling in love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how is one to begin?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Tredegar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, first cultivate a choice taste in food, wine, and cigarettes. Then
      disabuse yourself of the idea that the angelic, either in man or woman, is
      in any way desirable; purge yourself of that clog to all true appreciation
      of sensation&mdash;that interfering bugbear which still survives with an
      effete superstition&mdash;known as a conscience; get into an Hellenic
      state of mind by joyous perception of the beautiful, and realise that the
      supreme cultivation of the <i>ego</i> is the <i>ultima ratio</i> of
      existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then we should only love ourselves,&rdquo; observed a dissentient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As self-knowledge is the beginning of all wisdom, so is self-love the
      beginning of all passion,&rdquo; returned Mr. Singleton oracularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the frivolous chorus that followed this remark,
      Hammerdyke crossed the room and sat down by Clytie's side.
      &ldquo;You seem to be very merry over here. What is it all about?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only Mr. Singleton trying to play with paradoxes,&rdquo; Clytie replied,
      laughing. &ldquo;He is a chartered libertine, and nobody minds him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That always strikes me as so odd when I get back to civilised life&mdash;the
      tremendous amount of talking one has to get through&mdash;and no one seems
      to get any further with it. Everybody seems bound to provide himself with
      a theory of life, as they call it&mdash;either sincere or paradoxical. Why
      do they do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had pulled his chair a little aside, so that, when Clytie turned round,
      they were cut off from the main group close by. She replied laughingly to
      his question, and the conversation took a light, personal turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to have known you so long,&rdquo; he said after a while, &ldquo;and yet this
      is the first time I have been able to say a word to you by yourself. I
      used to hear of you, you know, in Africa, when Caroline sent me a budget
      of news. I used quite to wonder what you were like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline and I are great friends,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;She has been very, very
      kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a good sort, isn't she? She used to keep me posted up in all
      kinds of things, as I say&mdash;you amongst them. At last I built up a
      little romance about you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a crash it must have come down with!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that. Time will show. It was just after one of her
      letters that I read the story of 'Marjorie Daw,' which some good people
      sent me down with a package of books from Cairo. Do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read it, but forgotten it,&rdquo; replied Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, she remembered it very well. The words had come almost involuntarily.
      She was a little angry with herself. But it was pleasant to lean back in
      the armchair, amidst the babel of voices and heavy cloud of cigarette
      smoke, and be talked to thus pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a pretty little tale,&rdquo; said Thornton. &ldquo;A man writes letters to amuse
      a sick friend&mdash;broken leg, I think&mdash;and describes an imaginary
      young lady living opposite him. And the broken-legged man falls violently
      in love with this Marjorie Daw and starts off to see her as soon as he is
      well&mdash;and is moved to much wrath when he finds out the truth. Well, I
      am afraid I must confess that I made a kind of Marjorie Daw out of you&mdash;although
      I haven't exactly come over in search of you. So you see that we are old
      acquaintances&mdash;on one side, at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caroline must have been saying very foolish things about me,&rdquo; said
      Clytie. &ldquo;I remember Marjorie Daw now. I am not the least bit like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said you were,&rdquo; he returned, looking at her boldly, a smile
      playing about the corners of his mouth. &ldquo;I did not think so then, either.
      And since I am in for a kind of confession, I may as well say it did not
      occur to me that I should ever meet you. Now that we have met&mdash;under
      my cousin's wing, so to speak&mdash;I hope we shall make friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as if we had quarrelled,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I thought perhaps you might have been a little vexed at my
      confession. Are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clytie, looking at him in her quick, frank way. &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hammerdyke did not reply, but smiled and shrugged his shoulders a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you are so particular as to the wording, let us <i>be</i>
      friends. For Caroline's sake,&rdquo; he added after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, for Caroline's sake,&rdquo; repeated Clytie. &ldquo;Only, you know I am a
      very humble person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I know too much about you. You are by way of becoming a great
      artist&mdash;and it would be a privilege for an uncultivated barbarian
      like me. Tell me, how could we begin being friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose you tell me some of the wonders you have seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Anthropophagi, or men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders'? Very
      well&mdash;and you shall show me your pictures. Will you let me come and
      see them sometime or the other? Do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke low, with a touch of softness in his voice. Clytie felt
      flattered, touched. It was a little tribute to her womanhood to be pleaded
      with, especially by a man who, in the eyes of the world, was a recognised
      heroic figure. There was a latent light, too, in the depths of his dark
      eyes, a sign of reserved power and strange, unknown forces, that pleased
      her strangely. All the day she had felt sore, ill at ease, with a little
      aching, chafing sense of loss. The time had seemed woefully out of joint,
      and the setting of it right again utterly beyond her powers. But now the
      world's equilibrium seemed more stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure whether you would care for my pictures,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have seen those that Caroline has,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I made her show
      them to me. I don't know what your art word is&mdash;but they seem to me
      to have a grip upon life that I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not have chosen words more flattering to Clytie. They summed up
      bluntly the whole of her ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I like real things,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Something I can catch hold of.
      All this talk of Art with a capital A, and metaphysical preciousness, is
      so much froth&mdash;at any rate to me. But perhaps you put a capital to
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you will teach me what it means. Will you? It will be a way
      of teaching me something about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not worth your learning,&rdquo; replied Clytie, with a laugh. &ldquo;But you
      can come and see my pictures, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Hammerdyke, as he rose in obedience to a beckoning
      glance from Mr. Farquharson, who was sitting on the other side of the
      room. &ldquo;I will come as soon as you will let me. To-morrow, can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her pleadingly, admiringly. Clytie was suddenly brought in
      contact with a new force, against which she felt powerless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can come to-morrow,&rdquo; she said
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was an evening
      in mid-February that Clytie went to a dance given by the Redgraves in
      their large house in St. John's Wood. Redgrave met her almost as soon as
      she arrived in the dancing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have come at last&mdash;we had almost despaired of seeing you. I
      think there are a good many men you know&mdash;all dying to dance with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, give me a little breathing time,&rdquo; laughed Clytie. &ldquo;You have had time
      to fix on your cap and bells, let me adjust mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't touch yourself or you would spoil the effect,&rdquo; said Redgrave,
      mixing the metaphor for the sake of an opportunity of expressing his
      admiration of her beauty. &ldquo;I wish I could paint that portrait of you now:
      'Clytie, woman and artist.' There is one advantage about that combination&mdash;it
      assures perfect taste in dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked her up and down critically, stroking his long gray beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you like me,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;It cost me sleepless nights, I
      assure you. Didn't you know it was my serious occupation in life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear, I hope you will have your reward,&rdquo; replied Redgrave,
      laughing&mdash;&ldquo;only you won't find anybody who admires you and your
      genius half as heartily as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, smiled, and left her as one or two men came up to her,
      programme in hand. She gave them the dances they requested, and took a
      seat near the door by the side of some ladies of her acquaintance,
      watching animatedly the waltz that was in progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-evening, Miss Davenant,&rdquo; said a voice, deep and resonant, that made
      her start and the colour mount into her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Thornton Hammerdyke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I procured the invitation, and here I am. Where is your
      programme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her card attached with its bit of silk to her fan, and scribbled
      recklessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nearly filled it all up!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Let us dance out the fag-end of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his arm gaily, and with him entered the whirl of dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are looking dazzling to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What witchery have you to
      make your eyes so blue and your hair so glorious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and smiled half inwardly, thinking of Redgrave's late
      compliment and differentiating it from this. Each man was honest, in his
      own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put myself down for all those dances,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;because there is
      not a woman in the room fit to look at after you. I couldn't dance with
      them, and I should have been bored and irritated with standing and
      watching you dancing with other people. Then we can get away and sit by
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are all the men to do, to whom I have to be polite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must give way to the man to whom you are always fascinating. I
      scarcely saw you at all yesterday. Now is my chance, and I am going to
      make the most of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but there are the sacred conventionalities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you went in for being superior to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I am in a general way; I attach no intrinsic value to them&mdash;but
      they are useful as counters in one's dealings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed; pressed the fingers that he held in his left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night no checks are taken! It must be all solid gold&mdash;the true,
      real Clytie. As for people talking, you are glorious enough in your beauty
      to defy them. What can you and I care for idle gossip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words thrilled through her. Womanlike she had humbled herself before
      his greatness. To be raised thus by him to his empyrean, whence they could
      look down upon the rest of earth-bound mortality, in common grandeur, made
      her heart swell with a not ignoble pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do whatever you like,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this pitch of intimacy had the past three weeks brought them&mdash;a
      long enough period for an infinite number of things to happen&mdash;none
      the less real for being subjective. Nothing had changed in their external
      lives. Hammerdyke went into society, read a paper here and there on his
      travels, digested many bad dinners and worse flattery, played cards,
      smoked, and drank with his fellows. Clytie painted assiduously, read,
      exchanged visits with her friends. Kent was missing from her life. She saw
      him rarely, at odd moments, when they talked commonplaces and avoided by
      tacit consent the subject of their disunion. They were &ldquo;league-sundered by
      the silent gulf between.&rdquo; He told her that he was thinking of accepting an
      offer privately made to him by one of the heads of his department, of
      leave of absence for three months for the purpose of studying the
      numismatic collections of certain foreign capitals. The prospect was
      enticing, as he could thus have the run of the continental libraries,
      whereby his own great work could be considerably advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie listened kindly, wished him good luck. He went from her sad at
      heart, and she was angry with herself and humiliated at feeling somewhat
      relieved at the idea of his absence. It was not that she regretted the old
      life less. Its memories were still precious. But Kent's departure would
      clear the way to a better understanding of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much had happened during the past three weeks&mdash;the discovery of a new
      world for Clytie in which all was strange, beset with vague dangers,
      vibrating with a tremulous joy akin to terror. She had been lifted off her
      feet, hurried against her will into a whirl of new sensations. At first
      she resisted with fierce virgin pride; then gradually she began to close
      her eyes for a short sweet spell and allow herself to be drifted by the
      current; finally she gave up struggling. The history of most women at
      their first contact with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of this period is very simple. In its first developments love is
      usually not ultra complex. Given a man and a woman and conditions for
      meeting freely alone; further, a sudden overmastering passion on the part
      of the man, a half known, unfulfilled need in the woman; given these
      premises, and a child can deduce the result. It is the fundamental law of
      sex. Only when the sentimentalities and more delicate affinities come into
      play, when the needs of the finer animal man begin to cry after their
      satisfying, does love leave its simple phase and gird itself with its
      infinite many-coloured web of complexities. At first the mind may see the
      web glimmering in a far-away twilight&mdash;but heeds it not as long as
      the sense is held captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two remarkable personalities had met, Thornton Hammerdyke and Clytie. With
      the intensity of a strong animal nature he had fallen in love with her,
      with her beauty, charm, and directness. Her magnificent vitality drew him,
      compelled him. He shut his eyes to every other interest. The sense that he
      wanted her was sufficient justification for setting all else aside. He
      never even thought of marriage in the first flush of his passion. But that
      was the result of habit. Passion is a very different thing from the serene
      considerations that, according to the Book of Common Prayer, induce people
      to enter into the holy state of matrimony&mdash;and Thornton was quite
      free from any considerations of the kind. So that when marriage dawned
      upon his mind as a necessary condition, he accepted it, as a reckless
      sacrifice, as a means to an end, not as an end in itself. He was a man
      whose life had been passed in hot, headstrong action. Desire imperiously
      compelled immediate gratification. Since loving Clytie entailed marriage,
      he resolved to marry her forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      He informed Mrs. Farquharson of the fact, in his masterful manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to marry Clytie&mdash;so get yourself a wedding garment.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Farquharson jumped up, clapped her hands. She would not have been a woman
      had the possibilities of this match not occurred to her seductively. The
      announcement, however, anticipated her hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Thornton,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I am so glad! I have been longing for it. You
      two are made for each other. I must go down and see Clytie this
      afternoon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not,&rdquo; said Thornton. &ldquo;I'm going. Besides, I don't think Clytie
      knows it yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caroline's face fell a little. &ldquo;Oh! I thought you meant you were engaged,
      and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a detail&mdash;it doesn't matter. She's going to marry me, and
      you'll come and dance at the wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caroline kept her counsel, but she worked steadily in Thornton's cause,
      sang his praises to Clytie, invented many occasions for bringing them
      together. She believed with all the fervent loyalty of her nature that
      this marriage was an ideal one for her cousin and her friend, and had at
      heart equally the interests of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton very quickly constituted himself a factor in Clytie's life. She
      saw him almost every day in Harley Street, at home, or at the houses of
      common acquaintances. His influence grew strong upon her. Glimpses of the
      physical joy of life flashed before her like revelations. For the first
      time she doubted the possibilities of the artistic life. They seemed
      shadowy, unsatisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Thornton seemed to come realisation that something stronger, more
      real, positive lay beyond them&mdash;the delight of living in pulse and
      nerve and bodily fibre. Yet, unlike a man, a woman cannot live by sense
      alone. Sentiment invariably plays its part. This in Clytie's case was fed
      by the glamour of Thornton's heroic history, so different from that of
      ordinary men, whose lives, compared with his, seemed tame and colourless.
      The glow of his personality bathed magically all his actions, all his
      words. In his superb manhood he stood before her eyes as the incarnation
      of physical force, the victorious protest against the shams of art,
      culture, and other pale shades of our morbid civilisation. When she was
      lifted high with him in this triumph, sense and sentiment were fused
      together and she was wholly at his mercy. Thornton had come into her life
      at the most delicately critical moment of a woman's career, when the
      current of her nature, checked at the turning-point between friendship and
      love, struggles tumultuously for some other channel into which to empty
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall do whatever you like,&rdquo; she said to Thornton, during their waltz.
      It was the first definite surrender she had made to him. She was surprised
      that it cost her so little, seemed so sweet and natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you and I will defy the world!&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused to rest for a moment, leaning against the wall. An elderly man
      came up, shook hands with her, and opened a desultory conversation with
      Thornton. Clytie looked amusedly at the animated scene, tabulating
      mentally, by force of habit, the types that passed and repassed before
      her. Seldom had it struck her before so forcibly how few of her
      fellow-creatures possessed the secret of the joy of life. How many of the
      couples circling round, backing, glissading in that dizzying mass of
      motion were really gladdened by what they were doing? Stout men puffed
      around with a serious air of responsibility. Tall men, with drooping
      moustaches, paced languidly in time, scarcely heeding their partners, who
      expressionlessly suffered themselves to be guided hither and thither
      through the throng. The robust youth of either sex seemed to look upon
      dancing as an athletic exercise, and waltzed with the intent fervour of
      tennis players on their mettle before a big gallery. Only here and there
      did a girl, safe in the arms of a good dancer, half close her eyes and
      surrender herself to the sensuous charm of motion in perfect time with the
      throbs of music. Mankind is astonishingly ignorant of the essential
      qualities of many of its habitual pleasures. So thought Clytie, in the
      thrill of her new knowledge. The orchestra began the opening bars of the
      <i>coda</i>. Thornton turned away from the elderly gentleman, and putting
      his arm round Clytie's waist led her away, without a word, to finish the
      waltz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How delightful it is to dance with someone who is not bored by it!&rdquo; she
      said, when the music stopped and they were pushing their way through the
      crowd towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed in his boyish way, throwing back his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had better not answer that remark,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked askance at him as she asked, just as any little peasant girl
      would have done. Certain conditions bring all humanity to one level. He
      pressed the hand that was on his arm lightly against his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us get away by ourselves, and I will tell you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this opportunity did not occur. Thornton was captured by his hostess
      for introducing purposes, Clytie waylaid by brother artists for dances.
      When Thornton and herself were able to find seats the music struck up the
      prelude of the next waltz, and Clytie was discovered and led off by her
      partner. Only three men, exclusive of Thornton, had been fortunate enough
      to find places on her programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed away swiftly. She forgot her life, her responsibilities,
      her needs. During the three dances with the fortunate&mdash;which were
      early in the evening&mdash;she flashed with wit and merriment, her
      partners thinking with masculine self-esteem that they were the fine steel
      that had caused these scintillations. But more than one woman there that
      night observed how Clytie's eyes ever and anon caught those of Thornton,
      who was standing by the doorway. When the two danced together, men watched
      them curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the principle of natural selection could always be carried out like
      that!&rdquo; said French, the journalist, to Redgrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Physically, yes; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what? If the human race sprang exclusively from such parents, what a
      glorious race it would be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be a very good thing for the race,&rdquo; replied Redgrave drily; &ldquo;but
      I was thinking of the parents&mdash;at least of one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! a marriage like that would be ideal,&rdquo; said French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Redgrave shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; he said, with some earnestness. &ldquo;I know a little of Clytie
      Davenant. I may claim to have discovered her. She has the blood of life in
      her, it is true&mdash;but she has the finer artistic temperament as well.
      Mark my words, French; if she marries that man she will lose her art clean&mdash;clean;
      and not another 'Jack' will she ever be able to paint. Many of us men
      artists are ruined by marriage. A woman artist, to whom it means fifty
      times more, runs fifty times more risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps we are a bit previous,&rdquo; said French laughing, and turned
      the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening Thornton and Clytie came out of the dancing-room. She
      was flushed, dazed with the music, the noise, the electric light and the
      heavy scent of cut flowers; confused, too, by Thornton's presence, by the
      after-pressure of his arm around her waist, overwrought a little by his
      personal magnetism.
    </p>
    <p>
      They threaded their way through the crowd that lined the passage and the
      stairs, went through the brilliantly lit studio with its polished oak
      floor and wealth of hangings and costly decoration, into the models'
      dressing-room beyond, that had been turned into a small boudoir for the
      occasion. Many couples were wandering about the studio, examining the
      pictures and the china, but the dressing-room had escaped notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is soothing after the glare,&rdquo; said Clytie, sitting down restfully on
      a divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great palms screened the door, the room was hung with dark, heavy drapery,
      and between them shaded electric lamps shed a subdued light. Thornton sat
      down by her side. After a while the steps and talking in the adjacent
      studio ceased, and there rose from below the faint strains of the music
      and the dull rhythmic thud of the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were we talking about? I forget,&rdquo; said Clytie, after a short
      silence, and then, meeting his eyes fixed upon her, she turned away her
      head:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't! I can't bear it,&rdquo; she murmured involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he caught her hand: &ldquo;Clytie, you are adorable, glorious, bewitching!&rdquo;
       he cried, and kissed her quickly, twice, on the corner of her lips. She
      snatched her hand away and started to her feet, pale and trembling, her
      eyes blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do that? You have no right to do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, went to her, caught her wrists again&mdash;but this time she was
      powerless to withdraw them, and he spoke in a quick, deep voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the right to kiss you&mdash;to kiss you and kiss you till the
      world's end&mdash;for I love you&mdash;and I would sacrifice all I have
      got&mdash;my life itself, for one kiss from you&mdash;I loved you, wanted
      you, from the first time I saw you&mdash;when the suddenly lit light
      revealed your beauty to me, and you sprang glorious, bewildering out of
      the darkness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, let me go!&rdquo; she murmured, faintly struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not until you tell me that I have the right to kiss you&mdash;I know you
      will give it, you must! Clytie, I am stronger than most men, and my love
      is stronger than most men's and will not be denied&mdash;I will make you,
      force you to love me as passionately as I love you. Look at me. Speak! say
      just a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flashed a swift, sidelong glance at him, and met his eyes with the
      light burning in their dark depths. His passion intoxicated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she murmured. The words came almost without volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He released her hands. She remained standing for a moment, motionless with
      downcast eyes. Then she lifted them once more shyly, met his, and uttered
      a short gasping cry as he caught her in his arms and kissed her
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be my wife, and let our whole lives be one long kiss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, below her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later Thornton put her into a cab, and she drove home. The cold
      night air invigorated her relaxed body, but seemed to benumb her mind. She
      could not think&mdash;only feel Thornton's kisses upon her. The rest of
      the subjective and objective universe was a blank. Only when the cab
      stopped and the driver asked the number of her house through the trap-door
      in the roof, was she conscious of external things. Then she found that he
      had driven a long way past the familiar door. As he turned round
      grumblingly, she was aware of being chilled through from her drive across
      London, and longed to get indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until she told Winifred the next morning that she realised the
      great change that had come over her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to marry Mr. Hammerdyke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commonplace statement, thus uttered for the first time, seemed like a
      cold decree of fate, inevitable, irresistible. Winifred cried a little at
      the thought of losing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will be happy, my darling,&rdquo; she said, smiling through her tears.
      &ldquo;He is so brave and strong and handsome, and he must love you better than
      his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; said Clytie, gently stroking her friend's brown hair
      (Winifred was sitting at her feet) and looking tenderly at her pure,
      upturned face. But her own, bent down, was aflame with reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is it to be? Not for a long, long time, I hope,&rdquo; said Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost immediately&mdash;he wants it&mdash;there is no particular reason
      for waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt it was coming some day,&rdquo; said Winifred; &ldquo;but I did not expect it
      so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best,&rdquo; said Clytie&mdash;&ldquo;best that it should be at once; the
      interval between the old life and the new would be too trying if it were
      drawn out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You always do what is best, dear,&rdquo; whispered Winifred in her trustful
      way. &ldquo;Oh! you must be happy, very, very happy, Clytie dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie leaned back in her chair, caressing her friend's cheek with the
      back of her hand, and looked around the studio. It came almost as a shock
      to her to realise that in a short, short time she would have to bid
      farewell to all that had grown up around her artistic life. The grotesque
      caricatures on the walls stared at her like meaningless shadows. Her
      palette, brushes, and paraphernalia of rags and turpentine bottles lay
      strewn about like the properties of a forgotten comedy. The unfinished
      pictures on easels and stands lost their fascination. Only Winifred's
      little study on the other side of the studio seemed unchanged&mdash;retaining
      its virginal freshness and purity. But the sound of a step on the landing
      outside, buoyant, elastic, dispelled all wistful regrets. She sprang to
      her feet as Winifred rose, and listened, transformed into a radiant woman,
      with quivering depths in her dark blue eyes, her red lips parted in a half
      smile, her chin raised showing the full neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment or two afterwards Mrs. Gurkins appeared at the studio door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hammerdyke, miss. I have shown him into the sitting-room,&rdquo; she said,
      and then retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it was he,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, dear,&rdquo; said Winifred, putting her arm round Clytie's waist and moving
      with her across the studio to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie kissed her laughingly and disappeared. But two tears rolled down
      Winifred's cheek as she went back to the chair by the stove; and then she
      flung herself down where she had been sitting, and burying her face in her
      arm, began to cry bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like him, I don't like him; he will spoil my darling,&rdquo; she
      moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes knowledge is given to those who seek after it least.

      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he unexpected
      always happens, often inopportunely. Winifred had risen from the ground by
      the stove and was standing miserably before her easel when a knock was
      heard at the studio door. She cried, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; and Kent entered. He was
      looking rather pale and worn out, his beard sinking ever so little into
      his cheeks; his eyes were tired. On seeing him Winifred could not restrain
      a start of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Kent! you here at this hour of the day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I have just come back from the Museum. I went up to tell them I
      wasn't coming, as they say in Ireland. The fact is I am feeling lazy and
      want a few days' slackness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been overworking yourself, that's what you have been doing,&rdquo;
       said Winifred with kind severity. &ldquo;Come and sit down by the stove and rest
      yourself. You want someone to look after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the chair that Clytie had been occupying a little forward, by
      way of invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a good little creature you are, Winifred,&rdquo; he said as he sat down.
      &ldquo;You always think of other people. Men don't seem able to do it; they are
      too much wrapped up in themselves. How are you all&mdash;you and the
      children? You must make them invite me to tea soon. I have not seen them
      for ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are quite well again,&rdquo; replied Winifred, brightening, &ldquo;and they
      have been clamouring for Kent, as they call you. I'll tell them to send
      you an 'At Home' card. And it must be soon, for you are going abroad. When
      do you think of starting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent sighed and looked into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite know yet; I wanted to see Clytie first. Where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has a visitor&mdash;in her sitting-room,&rdquo; replied Winifred somewhat
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kent was too absorbed in his own affairs to notice the change of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she be engaged long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted so much to see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred looked at him for a moment and then came and put her hand lightly
      on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem so unhappy. Is it about Clytie? You and she have quarrelled or
      had some difference,&mdash;she has not told me what it is,&mdash;and I
      have been so grieved. If I knew, perhaps I might bring things straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you, Winifred?&rdquo; said Kent eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Don't I love Clytie better than anybody else&mdash;and haven't
      you been a good kind friend to me? I haven't asked her&mdash;nor you&mdash;why
      you have stopped being friends, because one shrinks from asking such
      questions, but I have seen it, and I have been so, so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentle sympathy touched him. The realisation of the feminine had come
      to him of late powerfully enough to have overset his old one-sided
      theories. He knew the value now of a tender word from a woman, and his
      nature hungered for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winifred,&rdquo; he said, half turning in the chair and looking up at her in
      his honest way, &ldquo;do you think Clytie could ever care for me&mdash;not as a
      friend&mdash;as something nearer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred fell back, looked at him aghast, unable to speak, as the light
      dawned upon her. He mistook her movement, rose, and began to speak
      hurriedly, pacing the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't help it&mdash;how could I help it? I have struggled against it
      with all my might. I know I am a fool to think that she can love me, and
      you are surprised and dismayed, as she was when she saw that I loved her.
      I would have bit my tongue out then rather than tell her, but I saw she
      guessed&mdash;and that is why our friendship has been broken. I have kept
      away from her to spare her the pain of it. But it has nearly driven me
      mad. I can't go abroad with the weight of it upon me. I must see her and
      let her know everything. Tell me, Winifred, you who are so fine and
      delicate, I did not wrong her and our friendship by growing to love her
      better than anything life has. She won't think me unworthy of the trust
      she gave me, and despise me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no!&rdquo; said Winifred half chokingly. &ldquo;Your love would honour
      any girl. Oh, why did you not tell her and plead with her before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you think, Winifred&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Kent with a sudden joy
      in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't!&rdquo; cried the girl, interrupting him; &ldquo;I can't bear it. It is too
      late! I hate to stab you like this, but you must know it. Clytie is
      engaged to be married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, during which neither looked at the other. Kent
      was stunned, dazed. He had come prepared for a refusal, but not for such
      an absolute shattering of all his hopes. He grew very white and stood with
      his hand on the back of a chair, as if steadying himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he said, at length, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only last night. She told me of it this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hammerdyke&mdash;Mrs. Farquharson's cousin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went up to him, took his hand, and turned her pure face up to his, the
      tears standing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't say you will find someone more worthy of you, because you
      couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not fit to tie her shoe-strings. I know that very well,&rdquo; said poor
      Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that is foolish,&rdquo; she said, with a wan smile. &ldquo;But there isn't
      another girl like Clytie in the world; and you will always think kindly of
      her, and help her if she wants help, won't you? You won't turn from her
      and hate her, as I have heard men often do&mdash;for I don't think you are
      like such men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would give up everything I had in life to save her one hour's pain,&rdquo;
       said Kent. &ldquo;I have been a fool,&mdash;I see it now,&mdash;oh! not in
      having loved her&mdash;not that. It is a blessed privilege&mdash;I can't
      explain, for you would not understand. I shall always love her, Winifred;
      no other woman can be to me what Clytie has been&mdash;and might have
      been. I shall leave by the early boat tomorrow morning, so you will not
      see me for three or four months. When I return&mdash;perhaps you'll let me
      come and talk to you a little sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it will comfort me,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;for am I not losing her too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bade her good-bye, exacting before he left a promise that she would not
      let Clytie know of what had passed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went downstairs, anxious to escape from the house, to get into the open
      air. In the entrance passage the side door leading into the shop was open
      and Mrs. Gurkins was standing by the threshold. Kent stopped for a moment
      to acquaint her with the fact of his sudden departure next day. He would
      keep on the rooms, which must be scrupulously locked up during his
      absence. Since his first intimacy with Clytie he had imperceptibly grown
      more amenable to feminine interference in his domestic arrangements, and
      Mrs. Gurkins no longer had her former terror of invading his domain. But
      she was still in enough awe of him to promise faithfully to execute his
      desires. To talk on these trivial matters was a relief from the terrible
      strain of the last few moments, although he wondered a little how he could
      lend them coherent attention. He was listening with waning interest to
      some final irrelevancies on the part of his landlady when a man ran down
      the stairs and strode quickly past him in the passage. A glance was
      sufficient to tell Kent who Clytie's visitor was&mdash;it had not occurred
      to him before to conjecture. His heart sank as he realised the splendid
      physique and proud, masterful bearing of his rival. Ordinarily the least
      observant of men in such matters, Kent noted the careless ease with which
      he wore his faultless attire. The patent-leather boots, the new silk hat,
      the well-cut frock-coat with an orchid in the buttonhole, the new gray
      Suède gloves grasped along with a gold-mounted malacca&mdash;all seemed to
      belong to the man naturally, to be the world's fit adjuncts to the gifts
      of nature. Smiling to himself and humming a song, he seemed the
      personification of the joy and strength, the success and luxury of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not that man's match,&rdquo; thought Kent bitterly, thus falling, as all
      men must do at times, a little below himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door slammed behind Hammerdyke. Kent waited for a moment, gave a
      few vague general directions, and then went out into the street. He felt
      stronger now that he had to struggle against real and tangible trouble
      instead of the intangible doubts and fears that had set him off his
      balance. The single-hearted loyalty of his nature, that had caused him to
      regard his love for Clytie as treason against her unsuspecting friendship,
      and had thus placed him in the weakness of a false position, now gave him
      strength to face fearlessly life and its responsibilities. But time alone
      could assuage the pain and bitterness of it all. He strung himself
      together and walked briskly through the bright, frosty air towards the
      home of his mother and sister in Notting Hill. There was sincere affection
      between mother and son, sister and brother; but neither of the quiet,
      contented women knew much of his life or sympathised with his ambitions.
      Mrs. Kent's hopeless wish was that he would marry some good, sensible girl
      who would keep his house tidy, provide him with decent meals, and bring
      bright children's faces around his knee. This conception bounded her
      horizon of a man's happiness; as she knew that her son would never appear
      within it, she regarded him with wistful, unhelpful affection. Agatha,
      with the younger generation's superior grasp of things, looked upon him as
      a soft-hearted eccentric who deserved to be humoured. For many years,
      therefore, Kent had ceased to share with them any of his inner life, not
      because he loved them less than during his boyhood, but because their
      mental attitudes precluded confidence. They were women, they could not
      understand. When he entered the house he left his own interests outside
      and plunged, in his rough, hearty way, into theirs. He gave his whole
      attention to accounts of Cousin Henrietta's baby, Uncle William's gout,
      the leakages of the cistern, and the turpitudes of the cook. In matters
      such as the cistern he gave practical help; in others, such as the baby,
      he overflowed with sympathetic though alarming suggestions. His own life
      was seldom touched upon. With finer natures&mdash;Clytie, Winifred, Wither&mdash;that
      divined the strong purpose underlying his eccentricities, and met him
      halfway with their sympathy, he was generous in his confidence; but to
      others, proud, shy, and reserved. So Mrs. Kent and Agatha knew nothing of
      Clytie, little of his scientific work, and only vaguely of his duties at
      the Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up Sloane Street and through the park, thinking of his great
      loss, trying to scheme out his future, in which Clytie would only be a
      memory. When he arrived at his mother's house he paused for a moment, as
      if literally to unstrap the burden of care from his shoulders and leave it
      outside the front door. Then he entered and greeted his mother and sister
      in his bluff, cheery way. He remained with them a couple of hours, during
      which he performed a few odd jobs about the house which he had promised to
      attend to, and then took his leave. Mrs. Kent was solicitous as to his
      health, besought him not to work too hard nor to come back with a German
      wife. She could not quite see the reason of his sudden departure. Why the
      country should waste its money in sending him abroad to study old coins
      she, in her placid utilitarianism, could not imagine. However, she bade
      him a motherly farewell, hoped from her heart that he would have a
      pleasant holiday, although she could not refrain from expressing a regret
      that he would not return in time to superintend the spring-cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the door closed behind him he picked up his burden and walked
      doggedly away with it, mechanically, not heeding his direction. He
      suddenly found that he had come, contrary to his intention, diagonally
      across the park to Hyde Park Corner. It was past five o'clock. Wither
      would be in his club. He would go and say good-bye, for Wither was very
      dear to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man was giving some directions to the hall porter when Kent
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, good creature!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what have you been doing to yourself?
      You are as white as a ghost. You want some whiskey or brandy, probably
      both. Come down to the smoking-room and have some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a bit overdone,&rdquo; replied Kent, &ldquo;and perhaps I have been walking too
      much to-day. But I don't want any brandy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you've got to,&rdquo; said Wither, and entering the smoking-room, he
      gave the order to a waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to say good-bye, Teddy,&rdquo; said Kent as soon as they were
      seated in a quiet corner. &ldquo;I am off to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deuce you are! Well, so much the better. A sound friend abroad is
      more comfortable for all parties than a sick friend at home. Have they
      given you your three months?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;on full pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky dog. And while you are flirting around the capitals of Europe we
      poor devils will have to be slaving away in this grimy and sooty
      metropolis. In the good fortune of one's friends there is always something
      devilishly obnoxious. Why is the eternal order of things so mismanaged
      that you should have a good time and I not? Here is your brandy. Drink it
      and look more human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent did as he was bidden. The stimulant, which he needed, revived him.
      Wither guessed that something untoward had occurred. He had a woman's
      intuition, this bright-eyed, cynical little being, and he rattled on in
      his light way to save Kent the strain of making conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have a cigarette?&rdquo; he asked, taking out his case. &ldquo;No? Well, smoke your
      pipe. I can't understand how anyone but a horny-palated son of toil can
      smoke a pipe. By the way, what do you think a girl sent me by way of a
      present this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;A hymn book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a cigarette holder&mdash;mouthpiece, you know. I wrote and told her
      it was very pretty and I would keep it in memory of her to my dying day;
      but as for using it, I should just as soon think of kissing her through a
      respirator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was unkind,&rdquo; said Kent, laughing in spite of himself, tickled at the
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you, no,&rdquo; replied Wither oracularly from the depths of his
      armchair. &ldquo;It is wholesome to check this frenzy of profusion now and then.
      When a woman once begins to give she never knows where to stop. When she
      has exhausted her imagination she gives away herself. It's embarrassing
      sometimes, for one can't put half a dozen women away in a drawer with the
      rest of the odds and ends. Oh, no; a little fatherly repression does a
      world of good to the ingenuous and enthusiastic. I don't pretend to be
      moral, but I am not without kindly instincts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled sardonically and began to turn over the pages of <i>Punch</i>.
      Kent smoked on in silence, cheered a little by the familiar chatter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teddy,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you seem to hear all the gossip about town; do
      you know anything about a man called Hammerdyke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thornton Hammerdyke&mdash;man from Africa&mdash;explorer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather. One of the greatest devils unhung,&rdquo; replied Wither
      cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Kent in an agitated voice, starting forward and
      gripping the arms of his chair. &ldquo;Take care what you are saying. It is a
      matter of life and death to&mdash;to somebody. What do you know about him?
      Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither arched his eyebrows in surprise, and became serious. Then his quick
      intuition supplied him with the reason for Kent's agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only spoke idle gossip,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have the misfortune to be
      hyperbolical at times. The man has had some dealings with our office and
      that is how I come to know anything about him. Don't you remember he got
      into a row for wholesale slaughter of niggers on one of his expeditions?
      He cleared himself all right, of course, by proving mutiny, self-defence,
      and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember the incident now,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;It was in the papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, his public character is cleared,&rdquo; said Wither, &ldquo;and he is a good
      deal of a lion these days; but fellows who have served with him take the
      niggers' side of the question, and wonder how he remained a day among them
      without being torn to pieces. That's all I know about him, which you see
      is not much. My dear old boy,&rdquo; he continued earnestly as Kent sat silent,
      staring in front of him, &ldquo;is that the reason why you are starting so
      suddenly? Is it all fixed up? No chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent nodded moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not. I was going to ask her this morning when I learned she had
      engaged herself&mdash;only last night&mdash;to this man. And I have seen
      him. Devil or not, he is a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wither bit his lip. For the moment he was at a loss for an expression of
      sympathy, somewhat uneasy as to the line he should adopt. What was the use
      of making Kent more miserable by telling him other ugly stories he had
      heard concerning Hammerdyke if either were powerless to prevent the
      marriage from taking place? Besides, it was only idle gossip after all,
      and in the serious affairs of life Wither was honourable and
      conscientious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Kent broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God, Teddy, I don't care a little damn about myself,&mdash;I can
      worry along, as I did before&mdash;better, for it is something to have
      loved her,&mdash;if only she is happy. But if this man is not fit for her,
      if this horrible gossip of yours is true, she will be entering into a life
      of misery,&mdash;I know her,&mdash;and I shall feel as if I had not put
      out my hand to stop her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everyone must dree his own weird, my dear old boy,&rdquo; said Wither. &ldquo;And
      while he's doing it neither you nor anyone else can interfere with much
      profit. Make your mind easy about yourself and your responsibilities. You
      could not go to her and say, 'I hear the man you are going to marry is a
      blackguard; have me instead.' In the first place, your pride would not
      allow you, and in the second, if she cared about him, she wouldn't believe
      you, but would marry him all the sooner to prove her faith in him. It is
      the way of women when they are worth anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Clytie would do just that,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;I think even a man would, if
      he loved a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Wither, &ldquo;it is no use making yourself miserable about it. The
      wise man guards against indulgence in things that upset his moral as well
      as his physical digestion. But wisdom was never much your forte, friend
      John.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent stayed and dined with Wither and then returned alone to the King's
      Road. He had already made certain preparations for travel; the few final
      arrangements did not take long. As he passed by Clytie's sitting-room door
      he noticed that it was ajar, a sign that she was out. In the old days,&mdash;less
      than two months ago, but far away for all that,&mdash;he had been
      accustomed to run down on such occasions, at about half-past ten or
      eleven, and stir up the fire. Since her return from Durdleham this little
      token of intimacy had gone with the rest. But on this evening the desire
      came over him to perform this service for her once more, for the last
      time. He crept down the stairs on tip-toe, in case she should have come in
      without his knowledge. But the door was still ajar, the room was vacant.
      The fire had burned down very low, only a few glowing coals at the bottom
      of the grate. He returned to his own rooms and fetched some wood and
      paper, and kneeling down, built up a satisfactory fire. At first, however,
      the wood would not burn; it had to be dried by repeated conflagrations of
      paper, and the blaze had to be induced by much cunning coaxing. It was
      just beginning to flare merrily up the chimney when the sudden slam of the
      street door below aroused him to a sense of his position. He left the room
      and fled quickly up the stairs. Outside his door he listened. It was
      Clytie, arriving home somewhat early. He was disappointed, a little
      humiliated. The freshness had gone from his sad little pleasure, for he
      had not wished her to guess that he had been down. Now the act seemed
      clumsy, in bad taste, as if he had been forcing his attentions on her. He
      went into his sitting-room with a heart heavier than before, and continued
      his preparations for departure. He had packed up his portmanteau and was
      now stowing away his papers and valuable odds and ends that he wished to
      remain under lock and key during his absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a step was heard on the stair that made his heart stand still,
      and Clytie appeared at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely find words to greet her. Now that their good comradeship
      was at an end, above all, now that she was lifted beyond his sphere, she
      held a different position in his eyes. She looked beautiful, queenly. Her
      rich hair and colouring, the pale blue of her dress, struck a note of
      exquisite brightness in the gloomy, half-dismantled room. He removed some
      books from his writing-chair and pulled it towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you to come!&rdquo; was all he could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you to look after my fire!&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not want you to know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a sentiment,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We are governed a great deal by such
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It touched me so,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;I could not help coming up to thank you,
      as you are going away early in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Winifred told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; she said you had come to bid good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent felt bound to fall in with Winifred's friendly fable, although his
      honesty shrank a little from accepting what was not its due.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always something sad in leave-taking,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark was trite and commonplace; but so is a kiss or a grasp of the
      hand or the words &ldquo;Good-bye, dear,&rdquo; themselves. The original generally
      brings more titillation than comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This leave-taking is sadder than most&mdash;to me,&rdquo; said Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to me too,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;It marks the end of the old life&mdash;a
      very pleasant one. Kent,&rdquo; she went on after a short reflective pause, &ldquo;I
      want to tell you something: I reproached you a little in my heart&mdash;last
      month. I don't now. I haven't the right. Winifred said she had let you
      know of my engagement. If our parting had not come from you, it would have
      come now from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see now; it was bound to come sooner or later,&rdquo; replied Kent, much
      moved. &ldquo;Oh, my God! what puppets we are. But I wish you happiness, from my
      heart, in your new life. You will always be to me the one woman whom&rdquo;&mdash;he
      was going to add, &ldquo;I could love,&rdquo; but he checked himself and quickly
      substituted, &ldquo;who has taught me what there is in women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear Kent,&rdquo; returned Clytie with a touch of her brightness and
      charm, &ldquo;there will be someone nicer than I who will teach you better. You,
      too, must have happiness, you know. You will marry soon&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I marry!&rdquo; cried Kent, wheeling round to face her. &ldquo;How can you say that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at one another, each misunderstanding. He was wounded at her
      treating his love as a thing of no account. She was puzzled at his implied
      contradiction of her theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had discovered the reason for your wishing to break off our
      intimacy&mdash;but I find I was wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; said Kent, agitated. &ldquo;I acted foolishly, very
      foolishly and rudely. Yet I only did it to save you pain. To break with
      you cost me the dearest thing I had in the world. Surely you must be aware
      of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not break it because you suddenly&mdash;during my absence&mdash;wished
      to form other ties?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light broke upon Kent, like a flash of lightning over a desolate
      wilderness. All of this heart-burning, then, was for nothing. She had
      never suspected that he loved her. A sense of the futility of things
      crushed him for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a man to fall in love readily,&rdquo; he replied in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Clytie earnestly, &ldquo;I am at fault. Why did you not answer my
      letter? Why did you shun me? Why were you so constrained when we met? Why
      did you tear yourself out of my daily life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned away his face, so that she should not see him as he fought out
      within himself a great battle. Had these words only been spoken a day or
      two ago he would have poured out his love to her in all its honesty and
      strength. But now she was bound to another irrevocably&mdash;now indeed it
      would give her pain to hear what he foolishly thought would have given her
      pain to hear before. Then he was restrained by misinterpretation of the
      meaning of the passion that had come surging into his blood. Now he was
      held back by finer feelings, ignorant perhaps, quixotic, but such as work
      in man to the shaping of his nobleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something I would rather not speak of,&rdquo; he said at last&mdash;&ldquo;something
      in my own life. I might have told you then; I was wrong not to; I did it
      for the best. I can't now. This seems like a cheap way of making
      mysteries,&mdash;perhaps it is one, not very big,&mdash;but it is better
      that it should be one to you. It was no fault of mine, believe me. You do
      believe me, Clytie, when I say that it was bitter for me to give up your
      friendship, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Kent,&rdquo; exclaimed Clytie, &ldquo;I do believe that you are everything that
      is true and tender and loyal. You don't know what strength and comfort
      your sympathy and your brave, frank way of looking at things have been to
      me. I have wronged you&mdash;forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, held out her hand to him. He took it and raised it to his lips
      very gently. Her eyes grew a little moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are treating me like a foolish woman, and not <i>en bon camarade</i>,&rdquo;
       she said in a low voice.

    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no longer my <i>bon camarade</i>,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;You are my very
      dear lady, whom I will serve till the hour of my death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment or two afterwards she was gone. The next morning Kent left
      England.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> great writer has
      remarked, that between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first
      motion, all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream, and that
      the state of man under those circumstances, like to a little kingdom,
      suffers the nature of an insurrection. Although the step that Clytie was
      about to take was not of the character that Brutus contemplated, it was
      sufficiently serious for the interval between her engagement and her
      marriage to be a time of great mental and moral upheaval. Her &ldquo;genius and
      mortal instruments&rdquo; had periods of fierce council, in which the latter
      always obtained turbulent victory. Dreading these inner conflicts, she
      shrank from introspection. When doubts began to creep over her she shook
      them off, and sat down and wrote letters to Thornton which she burned an
      hour or two afterwards. But it was only when she was alone in the studio
      hastily finishing the orders she had in hand, or during the few lonely
      evenings that she passed in her sitting-room, that these torturing
      misgivings arose. When Thornton was near she forgot that any had ever come
      to her. He overpowered her will and her senses, dominated her with a
      caressing word, a touch of the hand, a glance from the depths of his dark
      eyes. In the lucid intervals between these periods of dizzying surrender
      she did not recognise herself. It was almost as if some Morgan le Fay had
      cast around her a spell of woven paces, and changed her into she knew not
      what, while she saw the old Clytie fading like a dream-shape away. To
      women of finer temperament marriage looms shadowy, formless, a great
      enchanter that will change all things, deliver into their keeping the
      secrets of pain and delight. But to Clytie it was something less and
      something more. Its material responsibilities were less of a mystery to
      her than to most girls of her age, owing to the peculiarities of her
      self-training; but its spiritual and moral results were hidden from her in
      a cloud, denser, more lurid, more extensive. She loved Hammerdyke, not
      indeed as she would have loved Kent had he made one little effort to turn
      the wavering friendship into love&mdash;for then passion would have been
      finely tempered with tenderness, trust, and generous sympathy; but still
      certain chords of her nature vibrated fully in response to the touch of
      the man she was about to marry. The one might have, as it were, awakened
      the full organ, but the single diapason that was pulled rang out none the
      less true.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the short period of their engagement Hammerdyke was unceasing in
      tokens of his love. It was the nature of the man to throw his whole being
      into the delight or danger of the moment. Many a woman who cares
      lukewarmly, perhaps reluctantly, is fired with a gratitude akin to love by
      unending, passionate devotion. All the more responsive is the woman of
      full blood and emotional temperament who already cares greatly. Thornton
      gave Clytie no reason to doubt his affection; if anything, he frightened
      her by its excess. She yielded to him in all things, sometimes half
      dreamily, indifferently, without regret and without sweetness; sometimes
      the surrender was infinite joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one matter, however, she was called upon to exercise her will: Thornton
      did not care how or where the marriage was performed. A man loathes
      weddings, particularly his own. It is only the barbarian that lingers, as
      people say, in the heart of woman that demands ceremonies and pomps and
      vanities; a man, finer in some things, strangely enough, sees a certain
      indelicacy in the brazen publicity of the wedding rites. True, this view
      never presented itself to Thornton, who merely wanted to call Clytie his
      own and looked upon the formality of the marriage bond as a necessary
      nuisance, but it came vividly to Clytie, and caused her, as she was called
      upon to decide in the matter, to choose as quiet a wedding as possible.
      She shrank with repugnance from the meaningless ordeal of bridesmaids,
      favours, and a wedding-breakfast. It was only in deference to Durdleham
      susceptibilities that she did not entertain the idea of a civil marriage
      before a registrar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The announcement of her engagement caused a flutter of excitement in the
      family. Mrs. Blather and Janet could not understand a girl's art life, but
      they could understand a wedding. They settled it between themselves that
      Clytie and her <i>fiancé</i> should come down to Durdleham to be there
      married in the orthodox fashion. They had already drawn up a list of
      guests and a scheme of wedding arrangements when a letter arrived from
      Clytie saying that she was to be married almost immediately, and that on
      no account could the ceremony take place at Durdleham. The sisters were
      disappointed. Mrs. Blather remonstrated, adding arguments and entreaties
      that brought tears of desperation to Clytie's eyes. She hated the thought
      of willingly giving pain to her father and sisters, but a family ceremony
      was more than she could bear. By trying to explain the inexplicable she
      made matters worse. If Mrs. Blather and Janet had failed to understand her
      simple needs of a free, untrammelled girlish life, how could they unravel
      the tangled complexities involving her repugnance to their proposals? At
      last she wrote that the day was definitely fixed, and that if her sisters
      would not come to town, no one but her friends the Farquharsons and
      Winifred would be present at the ceremony. To journey up to London for the
      purpose of standing in a bleak, empty church on a dismal March morning
      just to see Clytie married in a travelling dress was a prospect not
      pleasing enough to be entertained. The sisters resigned themselves with a
      sigh to circumstances and to a catalogue of Clytie's eccentricities from
      her earliest years. Mrs. Blather sent Clytie a pair of silver
      candlesticks, Janet sent her a tea-service, and old Mr. Davenant, who had
      been courteously addressed by Hammerdyke on the subject of the marriage,
      sent her a check for one hundred pounds. And that ended the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred spent the night before the marriage with Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do come, Winnie dear,&rdquo; the latter had said. &ldquo;I shall be so lonely and
      miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Winnie came like a spirit of peace, and the two girls cried a little in
      each other's arms, and it was the weaker who comforted the stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall keep on the studio,&rdquo; said Winifred,&mdash;&ldquo;I am getting quite
      rich, you know,&mdash;and then you can come sometimes and take off your
      things and make believe to be back again. And I shall come and see you in
      your big house&mdash;if you will tell your big husband not to frighten me
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will always be my own sweet Winnie,&rdquo; said Clytie tenderly, &ldquo;and you
      will always get the very best out of me even if I change utterly to
      everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you change, dear?&rdquo; asked Winifred in her simple faith. For
      she had lost her first instinctive distrust of Hammerdyke in the glamour
      of Clytie's love for him. &ldquo;How can you ever be different from what you are
      and what you have always been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I may grow very, very wicked and selfish one of these days, and not
      care for simple things any longer; and then you might be hurt, and you
      would know how unworthy I was that you should care for me, and you would
      shrink from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Clytie, darling!&rdquo; cried Winifred, throwing her arms about her neck,
      &ldquo;how can you say such things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is silly, I know,&rdquo; said Clytie; &ldquo;but I sometimes feel that I might do
      something very wicked without much compunction before I die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are going to lead a splendid, beautiful life!&rdquo; said Winnie. &ldquo;You
      will live in a great house, and have at your command the most brilliant
      society in London, all the clever, artistic people&mdash;just what you
      like. And you won't have to paint for orders, so you need never have to
      cramp your genius, dear. Oh, Clytie, you will simply be overflowing with
      happiness all your life long.&rdquo; Clytie sighed. The independence of her
      half-Bohemian life was very dear to her. This was the last night on which,
      if it so pleased her, she could go forth into the streets, uncontrolled,
      whither she would. Henceforward her actions would have to be referred to
      an authority. To-morrow she would even change her name; be transformed
      from the Clytie Davenant whom she knew into Mrs. Hammerdyke, a vague,
      mysterious entity, with whose nature she was unfamiliar. No matter how
      glorious the future, there is always some regret in leaving forever a past
      phase of life:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      At leaving even the most unpleasant people <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
      places, one keeps looking at the steeple.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was a pleasant place Clytie was about to quit, and she looked
      back upon its associations with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning a commissionnaire sent by Thornton came and fetched away
      her trunks, for the newly married pair were to start for the Continent
      immediately after the ceremony. When these were despatched Clytie stood
      for a moment before her glass, adjusted the clasp of her cape and the set
      of her broad gray beaver hat, and turning to Winifred, said quietly: &ldquo;Let
      us go, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They drove together in a hansom to St. Luke's Church, close by, where
      Thornton and the Farquharsons were waiting for them, in the porch. It was
      a bright morning, warm for the time of year, and the sparrows and a stray
      thrush plucked up heart of grace and twittered cheerily from the trees in
      the churchyard. Two little street children, with arms about each other's
      necks, stood by a near gravestone and looked at the little group with
      somewhat disappointed eyes. They had expected a bride in a long white veil
      and orange-blossoms, a costume always mysteriously fascinating to the
      unsophisticated. Perhaps it was only a christening after all, one remarked
      to the other. But where was the baby? The interior of the empty church was
      more cheerful than empty Protestant churches are wont to be. The slanting
      sunlight streamed many-coloured through the stained windows across the
      nave, and a broad shaft poured in from the open south door upon the vacant
      pews in the aisle. From outside came faintly the hum and rattle of the
      King's Road. The influences were peaceful, encouraging, and Clytie,
      sensitive to impressions, felt grateful. The two little children, with
      their eyes on the verger, peeped in through the door and satisfied
      themselves that it was a wedding after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      They whispered together with many smiles and nods, guessing at the <i>dramatis
      personæ</i>. Clytie noticed them, smiled back and nodded. It was as if a
      bit of her past life had come to bid her be of good cheer. The party stood
      for a while in the body of the church, talking gaily in low tones. Mrs.
      Farquharson was radiant at the prospective accomplishment of a dear wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be proud of your bride,&rdquo; she said to Thornton. &ldquo;Is she not
      looking beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she whispered to Clytie:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be proud of your husband. Have you ever seen a man to compare
      with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton held his head erect as he gave Clytie his arm and walked up to the
      communion rail. He was proud of her. The quiet gray of her broad hat and
      her cloak threw into relief the rich colouring of her hair and eyes and
      lips. The past two years had completed her womanly beauty. Irregularities
      of contour below the eyes had been toned down, the delicacy of modelling
      of her face had been accentuated, and the new emotions of the past three
      weeks had filled her great dark blue eyes with a new, mysterious light.
      Thornton pressed her hand against his side, and whispered, &ldquo;My darling,&rdquo;
       so close to her that she felt his breath warm upon her ear. She looked at
      him for a moment, her full lips quivering ever so slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to kiss you,&rdquo; he whispered again. &ldquo;You are so beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments it was over. The words compromising a lifetime had been
      said. The wedding ring gleamed upon her finger. As she passed with the
      others into the vestry she looked down at it in a daze. There it was and
      there it must remain till death parted them, a token of submission and
      obedience. In the vestry there were embraces, congratulations. Thornton
      kissed her after the gallant fashion of a man who can afford to wait for a
      warmer caress. Winifred threw her arms round her neck, weeping. Mrs.
      Farquharson kissed her in her affectionate, motherly way. George kissed
      her gravely on the forehead and dipped the pen in the ink for her to sign
      &ldquo;Clytie Davenant&rdquo; for the last time. Then they found themselves in the
      porch again, saying farewell. Caroline laughingly called her &ldquo;Mrs.
      Hammerdyke&rdquo; as they finally parted. And then the little knot of three
      waved their handkerchiefs as the cab drove off that took her husband and
      herself towards Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mine now, my darling,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand. &ldquo;All that is
      most mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; she murmured, returning his pressure. &ldquo;Yours for always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The commissionnaire met them at the station. He had taken their tickets,
      settled their luggage, engaged a carriage. A bouquet of violets lay upon
      the seat. Clytie flashed a quick glance at her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for thinking. I love them so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He arranged her hot-water can and her rugs and sat down by her side,
      thrusting up the dividing arms impatiently. As soon as the train had moved
      out of the station he put his arms around her and kissed her, and spoke to
      her in tender, passionate words. The stop at Croydon broke the continuity
      of this first wedded embrace. On the platform outside the carriage window
      a loud altercation was in progress between the ticket-collector and a
      young couple who objected to pay for the ticket of a tiny terrier the
      woman was carrying. They were of the lower middle class, both in their
      Sunday clothes. She was a fair, delicate woman of some refinement; but the
      husband was coarse, vulgar, with the stamp of sensuality on his sharp,
      somewhat handsome face. Moreover, he was slightly intoxicated, and used a
      foul expression to qualify the collector after the official had departed.
      A flush rose to the young woman's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, John,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;He's in his rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the cad consigned his rights to perdition, and moved off vulgarly
      proclaiming his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie had heard this small scene in a life's drama and she vividly
      constructed the miserable tragedy. When the train moved on again she
      shivered, with a nameless, indefinable sense of fear. Three months ago she
      would have noted the scene for vigorous transference to canvas. Now the
      woman more than the artist was stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't talk&mdash;just for a little, Thornton,&rdquo; she said as he
      began to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her somewhat reproachfully. She drew off her glove and put
      her hand into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't understand&mdash;it all seems so strange. Let me gather myself
      together for a moment&mdash;darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She trembled on the last word. It was the first time she had used it to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand and leaned back on the cushions. Clytie looked out of
      the window at the telegraph poles and trees and broad fields swaying past.
      Whither was this tearing train carrying her? Out of her life into a new,
      strange world whose habits and customs and laws and speech were all
      foreign to her? She was married. She no longer belonged to herself. Her
      independence was gone. She had promised to love, honour, and obey this man
      by her side until death should part them. That would be a long time&mdash;many,
      many years. The thought frightened her. Until then she had scarce realised
      what married life meant, in this respect. Why had she married this man? As
      this question passed through her mind her husband raised the hand he held
      to his lips. The blood rushed hot to her cheeks, she did not finish the
      mental question, but turning quickly, looked at him for a moment, and
      falling under the spell of his eyes, yielded to his arm, forgetting all
      things. He had the power of drowning in a more lurid blaze those
      glimmerings of self-revelation. She whispered so to him laughingly, and he
      accepted it as a man generally does accept such things&mdash;not seeing
      that it was of deeper significance than a woman's ordinary tribute of
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my beautiful Clytie,&rdquo; he said, kissing her, and for a season she
      was content with the response.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a lover's silence between them, which she broke at length by
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it would have been much nicer if we could have had one
      another on trial&mdash;say for six months?&rdquo; >
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you could all the time be thinking whether you should repent of
      your bargain? Oh, dear, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you say that; but would it not have been better, if we grew to hate
      each other, to be able to shake hands and say good-bye? For we may quarrel
      dreadfully, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with tender assurances, laughed at her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall never quarrel if you are a good little girl and do as you are
      told,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie laughed, seeing only jesting in the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we shall never quarrel if you let me go where I like and do what I
      like and say what I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will always want to go and do and say as I like, darling,&rdquo; said
      Thornton. &ldquo;So we shall never quarrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will never want me to be severely respectable?&rdquo; asked Clytie,
      with a touch of insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan't allow you to flirt with any and everybody, if you mean that,&rdquo; he
      replied, showing his white teeth as he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean that&mdash;for the simple reason that I have a certain
      amount of brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have been many coquettes with magnificent intellects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply. Then, seeing that he had ruffled her, he adroitly
      turned their talk into less dangerous channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed in Paris a couple of days and then continued their journey to
      the Riviera. It was Clytie's own desire. In the first flush of his passion
      all places were alike to Thornton, provided she were with him. But she
      longed to get away from England, to cut herself adrift for a while from
      all old associations, to surround herself with new conditions, so that
      nothing should disturb the wonder of this new love. And when, with a
      lover's hyperbole, he had bidden her choose any spot on the whole
      terrestrial globe for the passing of their honeymoon, she had selected the
      Mediterranean.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the little Italian town of Bordighera, hidden away at the
      foot of the mountains amidst its palms and olive trees. Besides being one
      of the most beautiful spots on that beautiful coast, it has the charm of
      quiet. There is no casino at Bordighera, no public garden, no municipal
      band. It holds out to visitors no attractions but its own loveliness&mdash;hence
      the absence of the banal, the rococo. A few villas are dotted round it,
      away from the sea. One long, straggling street of shops, narrowing
      gradually, leads up to the old, picturesque, evil-smelling town on the
      hill. And this with its narrow sunless streets flanked by high, dingy,
      gray houses, between which the sky above seems a narrow strip of Prussian
      blue ribbon, its crooked byways and basement loggie of cool malodour, its
      cobble pavements on which great entrance gateways gape like dark, noisome
      caverns, offers few attractions other than those of quaintness and
      curiosity to any but its own inhabitants. It is a quiet place, devoid of
      the cosmopolitan <i>tohubohu</i> of Mentone or Cannes. An index of this is
      the fact that, save the commoner qualities of the Italian <i>regie</i>,
      cigarettes are not to be bought for love or money in Bordighera, and these
      in the greasiest ramshackle shop imaginable. If you want civilised shops
      you must go to San Remo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton and Clytie spent the earlier portion of their honeymoon here in
      unbroken happiness. Beyond casual gossip with their table d'hôte
      neighbours they held intercourse with no one. All fears, doubts,
      flutterings of regret, vanished from Clytie's heart, together with all
      sense of subjective life. She was tasting the physical joy of existence as
      it came to her in the passion, sunlight, colour, warmth, and scents of the
      south. She had chosen with unconscious wisdom. The intensity of the beauty
      of the Mediterranean, its positivism, its splendid denial of the
      melancholic and mysterious, held her being in tone with the love with
      which Thornton had inspired her. It intoxicated her with a complementary
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove one day from Bordighera through Ventimiglia to Mentone. Halfway
      they stopped at a wayside inn, and breakfasted under a trellis of
      grape-vine. On the one side was the dazzling white road, flanked by the
      terraced hill of olive-trees, the white underparts of their leaves
      flashing like silver; on the other, below, the gold sand and the purple
      sea. And the sun streamed through the vine, checkering the table and their
      hands and faces. The fare was poor and the Asti none of the best, but the
      wine sparkled and bubbled in the thick tumbler they used in common, and
      brought a keener sparkle into Clytie's eyes, and a more joyous abandonment
      into her laugh. When they had resumed their drive, and a turn of the road
      brought them into sight of Mentone, her heart leaped at the suddenness
      with which the blaze of colour was revealed. Below, over a declining
      foreground of olive and orange gardens, lay the white town in a setting of
      bright green foliage, stretching from horn to horn of the bay. Behind the
      eastern horn projected dark and bold the promontory of Monaco with the
      flashing white of its castle. Behind the town rose the two bare peaks of
      the Berceau standing out in deep blue-gray against the intense violet sky.
      Before it swept the broad belt of yellow sand, on which lapped, in little
      idle waves whose ebb left a delicate fringe of white, a still, unbroken
      sea of lapis lazuli, melting through infinite gradations of blue streaked
      with arbitrary purples into the deep ultramarine that met the paler sky
      far away on the horizon. The burst of intense colour of sky and sea and
      land, glowing as far as the eye could sweep, drowned Clytie's being in a
      sensuous flood. It was, as it were, the projection of physical passion
      into something visible, thus baring to the eyes its wonderful beauty. She
      uttered a little inarticulate gasp, a catching of the breath. They were
      quite alone, the coachman half asleep in the sun on his box. Thornton put
      his arm round her and drew her to him. She turned, closed her eyes. All
      creation, from the world of wonder before her to the tiniest quivering
      fibre within her, vibrated with an intoxicating thrill of delight. She
      caught his hand, drew his arm tighter, and lifted her lips to his in a
      long, long kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforward her stay on the Riviera was one uninterrupted delight. It
      was a dream in which the mind lay subject to the sense. She was in a blue
      mist, which hid impenetrably past and future, and informed the visible
      area about her feet with unutterable sweetness. &ldquo;Don't expect me to write
      letters,&rdquo; she said in a hastily scribbled note to Caroline. &ldquo;This is a
      land in which words have no part. You might as well expect me to talk the
      'Moonlight Sonata' to you.&rdquo; And Caroline, being a wise woman, smiled. Yet,
      after all, her wisdom had nothing to do with it&mdash;for anything
      feminine would have divined. The days flew on wings of fire. She never
      read, never worked; her sketch-book remained empty. Often they sat at
      their sitting-room window, looking out on to the Strada Romana, hand in
      hand, without speaking, save for a murmured caress, for an hour together.
      Or they walked up between the olives, past the famous high wall with its
      gorgeous coat of mesembryanthemum, through the narrow, crooked town, down
      the rugged descent to the surf-beaten shore, where the great white
      solitary <i>casa</i> stands, and there sat down in the shade of the big
      rocks and watched the glowing &ldquo;countless laughter&rdquo; of the sea. Often they
      rambled through the cool, sunless olive gardens, rising terrace after
      terrace apparently into the deep violet sky. The scent of the rosemary and
      wild thyme beneath their feet rose penetrating and filled the blood, and
      Thornton would pick a handful, and laughingly hold it between them above
      their lips as he kissed her. And when they reached the top of the hill
      they sat under a tree, and Clytie rested her head on his shoulder, and let
      her eye wander over the low-lying ridges of the Maritime Alps rising in
      endless soft-rounded undulations, like the many-breasted mother of men, in
      each bosom nestling a compact white townlet gathered around the slated
      cupola of its church; and the soft sunlight lay over all, transfused
      through the blue atmosphere. Then she would say: &ldquo;Don't let us talk,
      Thornton,&rdquo; but there was a different meaning to the words from that which
      they had when she uttered them in the train as it left Croydon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes they went away from Bordighera for two or three days; visited
      Nice, Cannes, Monte Carlo. At Monte Carlo Clytie won three or four hundred
      francs at the roulette tables. Gambling had never come before within her
      experience of things. She plunged into it with childish recklessness,
      looking round with glowing face and laughter in her eyes at her husband
      when she won, and drawing a short little breath of dismay when the
      croupier raked in her stake. The game, the intensity of the strange faces,
      seen nowhere else,&mdash;faces which bore the stamp of combinations of the
      seven deadly sins taken from two to half a dozen together,&mdash;the
      subtle working in that great, glittering room of all the passions under
      heaven, attracted her, fascinated her. The artistic temperament caught the
      impressions, instinctively, unconsciously registered them, thus widening
      and deepening her conception of life. It was a luxury of sense to leave
      the babel passion of the Casino and to walk arm in arm on the terrace or
      in the grounds. There the music came faintly and mingled with the far-off
      splash of the sea away below them and the rustle of the palms and
      drachinas. On the right stretched out Monaco, clustering like a group of
      fireflies below the white bastioned castle. Behind them rose the black
      mass of the Maritime Alps with the Mont Agel towering distinct above. The
      air was soft and warm, recovering from the sudden shock of sundown. What
      they said to one another matters little. He saw that she was beautiful and
      filled with the sense of his love, and he was happy. To Clytie life meant
      unutterable things.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third morning of their stay at Monte Carlo Thornton returned from a
      short stroll and came into their room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man I know has just come by the train and I fled from him,&rdquo; he said;
      &ldquo;let us go somewhere else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad you still want us to be quite, quite alone,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But
      you are sure you are not a little bit weary of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He answered as many millions of men more or less sincere have answered.
      And Clytie thought neither of believing nor of disbelieving him, as many
      millions of women have done. The subjective is apt to crop up afterwards
      and it generally causes trouble. But in the passion of a kiss woman,
      being, like man, of flesh and blood, and not an abstraction, does not
      calculate remote psychological contingencies; if she does, the kissing is
      all a mistake. Once, towards the end of their honeymoon, Clytie did touch
      upon the subjective. They were sitting by the ruined tower on the hill
      above the Strada Romana. Clytie was heated and had taken off her hat, and
      the breeze ruffled her hair as she leaned against the trunk of a tree.
      Thornton sprawled by her side, resting his chin on his hand and looking at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always grudge your wearing a hat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your beautiful hair ought
      not to be hidden. You look much lovelier now that it is free for the wind
      to kiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed a contented little laugh, throwing her chin up, according to
      her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Thornton,&rdquo; she said with a little hesitation, in which there
      was much charm, &ldquo;being called beautiful every day is one of the great
      novelties of the situation. I always knew I was good to look upon, and
      sometimes I really was very pleased to behold myself. But before I knew
      you, dear, it never made anything of a factor in my daily life. And now I
      almost begin to think it's the only quality I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given that, you can let all the others go&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He waved his
      hand vaguely, consigning them to the <i>Ewigkeit</i>. &ldquo;But that's not all
      that you love me for, is it, dear?&rdquo; An idle question, with an unsuspected
      fear lurking in its heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why I love you. It has never occurred to me to investigate
      the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, try. It will be like playing the game, 'I love my love with an A'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton shook his head boyishly, and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would spoil it all!&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;to go worrying about what lies
      under that sweet face of yours. Can't you understand, darling? What do
      your qualities matter to me? Provided I can take you in my arms and kiss
      you as much as I like, what concern is it of mine whether you are
      acquainted with the cookery book or spell art with a capital A? Don't you
      think it's more satisfactory to lie here and look into your great blue
      eyes, and your hair with the sun and wind playing hide and seek in it, and
      your bosom rising and falling, than to speculate whether you are
      even-tempered or vindictive or ambitious or fond of Adelaide Proctor's
      poetry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a boy you are!&rdquo; she cried light-heartedly, stretching out her hand
      so as to run her fingers over his crisp brown hair. &ldquo;So my face has been
      my fortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your figure,&rdquo; he remarked critically. &ldquo;The whole of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;what would you have done if I hadn't married
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started up to a sitting posture, and his eyes flashed. &ldquo;I should have
      gone straight back to Africa and played the very devil there! But you were
      bound to marry me, you know; and if you had been already a married woman,
      I should have got to you somehow. I have been hit before in my time, over
      and over, but never till I met you did I think a woman worth the marriage
      service. But you're a witch, Clytie,&rdquo; he added, resuming his former
      attitude, &ldquo;the Belle Dame sans Merci.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;poor knight-at-arms! And you do look 'so
      haggard and so woe-begone,' don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as she looked at his great frame lying at her feet, and his
      strong, handsome dark face, with its health and masterfulness. Then she
      continued in the lightness of her heart:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But seriously, now, Thornton, very seriously. You do want me to be a
      little help to you in your life&mdash;in other ways&mdash;don't you? In
      your ambitions, your work in the world generally. We must begin to talk
      about such things soon, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton laughed lazily as he lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My work in the world is to love you, my dear, and I'll promise to let you
      help me in that as much as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Clytie insisted. Sometimes the subjective gets too much for a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Thornton dear,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to feel that we are much more than
      lovers. That will wear off after a time. Oh, yes! don't tell me it won't;
      a woman learns things all with a rush, you see. And I want to feel that we
      are one in everything, in all our sympathies and views of life, our
      ambitions, in all the high and great things that lie before you. I want to
      be in touch with everything you do and think&mdash;to be a real helpmeet
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand and kissed it, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got a lot to learn in the way of connubial responsibilities,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;You'll have to train me, my dear. But allow me to remark that the
      sun is just going to dip over there by the Nervia, and if we want to get
      in by sunset we shall have to run like the deuce!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As this was a serious matter,&mdash;on the Riviera it is one of the grave
      responsibilities of life,&mdash;Clytie let herself be lifted to her feet,
      put on her hat quickly, and holding her husband's hand, ran merrily with
      him down the hill. The exercise and the laughter drove things subjective
      out of her head for a season. But in the after-time the ghost of this
      little conversation came and sat at the head of her bed, making mock at a
      few others who sat on the foot-rail. A thing does not require to be as
      objective as a murdered monk to have a little ghost all to itself.

      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>erhaps if they had
      remained in Bordighera the intoxication would have lasted longer. But as
      our lives are hemmed in by infinite possibilities, to each of which is
      strung its infinite ramification of consequences, it is somewhat rash to
      predicate <i>ex hypothesi</i>. At any rate so long as they were at
      Bordighera there seemed to be no reason that the continuity of the charm
      should be broken; whereas it did suffer a change during the railway
      journey from Bordighera to Paris. And this railway journey was a kind of
      neutral ground in their married life, separating the dream from the
      reality. On entering the train they were lovers. On leaving it they were a
      married couple. Wherein lies somewhat of a difference. They were not
      conscious of the change. Realisation of this mysterious operation is
      fortunately denied to human beings, seeing that they turn their eyes
      inwards rather too much as it is already. Nor do they recognise what has
      happened until some time afterwards, as the old influences still remain
      lingeringly; but then they can generally look back to the point of
      transition, and set it up as a forlorn landmark in their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why they did not remain longer in the south they themselves could scarcely
      explain. They had arranged to spend a month there, and then to proceed to
      Paris to wait indefinitely until their new house in the Cromwell Road
      should be ready to receive them. There is nothing so irrefragable as an
      arbitrary programme. Even the most emancipated enslave themselves to it
      sometimes, as in the present case did Thornton and Clytie They possibly
      lost a good deal,&mdash;the flowers of life seldom grow along the beaten
      track,&mdash;but they never thought of attributing it to the fixity of
      their programme. They were in Paris, then, living under totally fresh
      conditions. Thornton found there a succession of friends and
      acquaintances, and was pleased rather than otherwise to meet them. At
      Monte Carlo he fled from Carteret of the Hussars; on the Boulevard des
      Capucines he greeted him heartily and carried him off into the American
      Bar. Besides discovering acquaintances daily in the hotel list, Thornton
      was not unknown in general Parisian society. His name could procure him
      admission into most circles that he cared to enter. He was put up at a
      couple of clubs and received invitation cards by the dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      To please him Clytie went with him a little into society. He was proud of
      his beautiful wife, loved to watch the effect produced as she entered a
      drawing-room upon his arm, and the eager admiration on the faces of the men
      who crowded round her chair. In fact, Clytie had a small social success&mdash;and
      a paragraph in the <i>Figaro</i>. It was a new sensation for her; but in
      these early days of her married life she would have preferred a quieter,
      less conspicuous existence. But Thornton, just as he had sought in the
      south to keep her and her beauty to himself, now seemed to wish to exhibit
      it abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to wear you like a decoration, darling,&rdquo; he said once.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Clytie flushed with pleasure at the little flattery. Then she
      thought over it for a bit, and it did not please her so much. But she did
      not confide this to her husband. She had already begun to discover that
      for the safekeeping of many little matters her own heart was the best
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a set of rooms in a hotel in the Champs Elysées with a balcony
      overlooking the Grande Avenue. Clytie loved to sit there with Thornton in
      the quiet half hour before dinner watching the stream of vehicles, fine
      and vague far away by the Arc de Triomphe, then gradually broadening, till
      fashionable Paris returning from the Bois blazed beneath her in its
      movement and gaiety. They seemed to her so alone up there, above the whirl
      and the glitter and falseness. It was a return of the hours of the month
      in the south, and happiness fluttered tremulously around her&mdash;like a
      butterfly, ever so elusively. When she leaned over the balcony by his side
      many people looked up admiringly at them. When she saw one woman twitch
      the arm of her companion in a victoria, and both shoot swift feminine
      glances up at the balcony, she could not help feeling a little thrill of
      pride in her husband. And then she would remember the morning's solitary
      ramble among the sculpture of the Louvre (Thornton and herself were less
      dependent upon each other now for entertainment), and reflect, with a
      sense of pleasure, that she had seen no antique ideal that could compare
      with him in splendid manhood. He, too, had done heroic deeds, she would
      think, and she would move nearer to his side and be glad that he was
      there. Yet the butterfly happiness was just beyond her grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some such thoughts were passing through her mind one afternoon as they
      stood together on the balcony. He broke a short silence by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are getting quite an old married couple, Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you say that?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I hardly know. I have got so used to having you by me. It seems as if
      I had been married ever since I was born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem a long, long time ago that we first passed through Paris.
      But I can't say I am quite used to matrimony yet. Do you know, I have
      sometimes hoped that I never should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you guess? At present, dear, it is all glamour and mystery, and
      when you get too familiar with the glamour it turns into the commonplace.
      That's why I am just a little bit sorry we left Bordighera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was certainly very jolly,&rdquo; he assented reflectively. &ldquo;But we are
      having as good a time here, aren't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I like these little half hours best,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;when we are
      alone together. When we are parted it seems as if I am suddenly called
      upon to live as an individual and do not quite know how to begin. You see,
      when I am alone with you I know how to behave as Clytie Hammerdyke, but
      not yet when I am by myself or with other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton laughed, as a man in love laughs when he thinks he is replying to
      an idle, pretty remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have always Clytie Davenant to fall back upon,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I? That's just the question I have been putting to myself. But I
      can't explain it to you. I don't think you would understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I understand!&rdquo; he cried quickly. &ldquo;You have to mix with people
      as a married woman, and you are a bit shy at first. But you'll pull
      through all right, dear. Why, as it is, you are superb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come,&rdquo; she said, laughing. &ldquo;I can talk to people without blushing and
      morally biting the corner of my apron. I meant something a little more
      subtle than that. You see, after all, you don't understand. I can never,
      never be Clytie Davenant again. She was buried for good and all at
      Bordighera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my sweet phoenix has arisen out of her ashes,&rdquo; said Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you like&mdash;and the phoenix hasn't quite got the sense of her
      environment yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very pretty, my dear,&rdquo; said Thornton, with a laugh. &ldquo;But I
      can't quite see what we are driving at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I been talking such great nonsense, then? Perhaps it all tended to
      express the fact that when I am with you I don't think of myself; when we
      are apart I am confronted with myself, and feel embarrassed. You see,
      Thornton dear,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I have lived a queer kind of life, full of
      such different hopes and dreams. I scarcely thought about marriage in
      those days. I knew that love would come to me some time or the other, but
      then it seemed as if it would all be mixed up with my art, whereas now&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
      you can't see how different it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no tone of sadness or regret in her voice as she said this, but
      a touch of tenderness, a tribute, as it were, to his influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's nothing to hinder you from amusing yourself with painting
      pictures, is there?&rdquo; asked her husband lightly. &ldquo;You have no call now to
      earn a livelihood, but you can paint all day if you like, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I shall paint&mdash;I could not live without it&mdash;except
      perhaps such a month as last. But, don't you see, my art was once the
      guiding principle of my life. Now I have my art and my love, and they seem
      to have nothing to do with each other. They are on different planes, so to
      speak. It is all that that makes me feel I don't quite realise myself yet
      when I have to leave the love plane for a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't leave it,&rdquo; said Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! we have done that by going away from Bordighera, and leading this
      dissipated life here,&rdquo; she replied, laughing. &ldquo;But we can get on and off
      whenever we like, you know. That is one comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Thornton, lighting a cigarette, and speaking between the
      first few whiffs, &ldquo;marriage must make some difference. You have lived a
      free and easy, emancipated life among artistic people, and now you belong
      to somebody else&mdash;a wild barbarian, who could no more tell you how to
      paint a picture than how to cut out a dress. Of course it makes a
      difference in your way of viewing things. It has made a difference in mine
      too, by Jove! When a yearning for Africa comes over me I have to say: No;
      I have a wife, with her arms,&mdash;the roundest in the world, my dear,&mdash;about
      my neck. And so I have got to settle down to politics and domesticity in
      the Cromwell Road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't regret it, do you, Thornton?&rdquo; she asked, womanlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at me and see if I do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie obeyed him, half shyly, feeling, as she always did since her return
      to Paris, the fascination, half pleasant, half painful, of his eyes. He
      loved her. There was no doubt of that. Yet the nature of his love
      sometimes frightened her a little if she strayed for a moment off the
      &ldquo;love plane.&rdquo; Her own responsiveness she never questioned, preferring to
      shut her eyes and let the current of his love carry her whither it would.
      But at times now, during her solitary walks through the Louvre, the
      thought obtruded, What would the new life be like? Not these early days,
      which were holidays from the seriousnesses of existence, but the life in
      the years that lay before her, of whose responsibilities she had as yet
      but vague premonitions. How would her art be affected?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would it lose or gain in that breadth and insight that it needed? Would
      she continue to reckon herself an artist at all, or would she only
      degenerate into the amateur&mdash;painting little meaningless pictures for
      amusement? And at the end of a year would she not stand face to face with
      a new Clytie, paler, more shadowy, and therefore less insistently
      demanding self-expression? Even these few weeks had changed her: what
      would she be at the end of one year, two years, twenty years? Happier,
      with all her old cravings satisfied, with her individuality worked out to
      its fullest, with the riddle of life joyously solved? Or else&mdash;&mdash;She
      scarcely dared think of it. She looked at what had been written in her
      Book of New Formulas, and found that the marriage service had been
      omitted. It merely said that marriage was unformularisable, an easy way of
      curving a contumelious lip at the old formulas which she had rebelled
      against, but scarcely satisfactory in her present position. Now, in the
      Old Formulas, marriage was minutely, scrupulously regulated by the most
      definite of rules. Although they broke up the poem of life into a
      disjointed copy-book, or at best into a collection of elegant extracts,
      still they presented a homogeneous scheme. Should she at last have to
      accept this, confess to Mrs. Blather smiling complacently that the
      Durdleham philosophy was the only one? But then she would look at her
      husband and take a measure of comfort. Such a man could not come out of
      Durdleham.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was her consolation in the perplexities that the problem of her
      married life caused her. She took refuge from herself, her thoughts, her
      forebodings, in his grand strength and personal magnetism. It was
      intermittent intoxication, this long Paris after-honeymoon, rather than
      continuous charm, and the intervals of soberness had their wearinesses.
      She had thrown her cap over the windmills. Sometimes she regretted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening after the above conversation they went to the opera, where
      they had taken a box with the Claverings, army people with whom Thornton
      had been intimate in Cairo. Clytie had met them only for a moment the day
      before, and had not been favourably impressed. However, they were
      Thornton's friends, and it behoved her to appreciate them. Mrs. Clavering
      passed for being a clever woman by virtue of a plain face and a vivacious
      manner; also because she ruled her husband and had a cultivated taste in
      sherry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton had admired her some years before. Mammas with marriageable
      daughters put it in that way; those who could afford to be independent put
      it in another. Whichever way they put it in no wise affected the parties
      concerned. Mrs. Clavering was too superior a woman to allow idle gossip to
      influence her or her husband. Now she was eight-and-thirty, she had seen
      the world and had preserved few illusions, least of all any respecting
      Thornton Hammerdyke. She met him with a cynical encouragement, which to
      some men is flattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie was quick to notice her manner towards Thornton, and resented it.
      There was a touch of banal familiarity, too, in his talk with Mrs.
      Clavering that jarred upon her. The tone was undignified, suggestive of
      the falser strata of regimental society, in which frankness stands for
      scarcely veiled mutual contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting behind Mrs. Clavering, who smiled in a superior,
      half-patronising way at his remarks. Clytie listened to the music
      absently, wished they had come alone. The house was crowded, and the air
      was stifling. She found the opera, &ldquo;La Juive,&rdquo; uninteresting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to carry off your husband to the terrace, Mrs. Hammerdyke,&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Clavering at the end of the second act, &ldquo;and I leave you mine in
      pledge. I hope he will take good care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a heavy but honest Briton, who idolised his wife, his dinner, and
      the British Constitution. As neither the opera nor Clytie came within this
      area of adoration, he treated them with a polite though somewhat
      embarrassed indifference. Still he acquitted himself of his charge
      satisfactorily and entertained Clytie during the <i>entr'acte</i>. After a
      tour round the house he found a seat for her in the Salle des Pas Perdus
      and talked with solemn fitfulness. Then it occurred to him that it was
      oppressive indoors and he took her out upon the terrace. Clytie did not
      wish to stay there long&mdash;only for a moment to get a breath of fresh
      air. She remained for a little leaning on the broad balustrade and looking
      at the scene in front of her&mdash;the broad <i>place</i> below with the
      continuous passing to and fro of vehicles crossing each other in all
      directions, the Café de la Paix on the right with its crowded tables far
      out on the pavement and trayladen waiters hurrying between them, the
      glittering vista of lights in the Avenue de l'Opera, the duller line of
      lamps in the Rue de la Paix with the Vendôme column towering high in the
      dim moonlight. It was so instinct with gaiety and movement and the
      brightness of life that a little thrill of its gladness passed through
      her, ending in a strange kind of sob that filled her throat. She took her
      companion's arm, and went across through the stream of loungers back into
      the heavy air of the Salle des Pas Perdus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Thornton and Mrs. Clavering had established themselves in a
      corner at the end of the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems like old times&mdash;on the veranda&mdash;at a regimental
      dance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At least that is what you were going to say, I suppose.
      I never yet met an old admirer but what he made some remark of the kind.
      So I have saved you from the commonplace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was meditating some politeness of the sort,&rdquo; replied Thornton
      carelessly. &ldquo;I thought you would expect it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will always have the same delicate consideration for others,
      Mr. Hammerdyke. How long are you going to be good and domestic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, I suppose. I am going to run politics and that sort of show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clavering laughed lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! When I see you at it I'll believe it&mdash;unless you have changed
      extraordinarily since I last knew you. And you don't look much changed.
      Perhaps matrimony will work the miracle. Ha! ha! Pardon my laughing, but
      it seems so ridiculous to see you, of all people, married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I have human attributes somewhere about me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too vastly human, my poor friend; that is where the danger lies. To err
      is human, you know. I hope your wife will do the divine part of the
      business, as women generally do, and forgive. By the way, I have not made
      you my compliment, as they say in this country. I think your wife simply
      perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We agree there for once,&rdquo; replied Thornton drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me all about it. Can't you see I am dying to know? That is why I
      brought you out here. Who is she? Where did you meet her? Were you long
      engaged? And I know you too are dying to talk to someone about her. You
      may as well gratify the craving while you still have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are madly jealous, Clara. Pardon my frankness. But you and
      I always went in for being frank with one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it amiable brutality&mdash;it would be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like. I never went in for splitting hairs. I suppose it's brutal
      to say you are jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is simply idiotic. Therefore I bear you no ill will for your saying
      so. I honestly admire your wife, and think you have got very much more
      than you deserve, and I am femininely curious. Now perhaps you will tell
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I met her at a cousin's house. She is, or rather was, an artist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I appreciate the distinction. Proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton threw himself back with a great laugh against the balustrade, his
      elbows resting upon it, his hands in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are just a little bit jealous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well&mdash;to
      finish my story. She is of an old Buckinghamshire family, and we were
      engaged about a month. And then we were married. But tell me, by way of
      changing the conversation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which may be painful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely. How long are you going to stay in Paris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. As long as Paris pleases me. Am I going to see you any
      more, or are you too much engrossed? I don't want to take you away from
      your duties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you are likely to, Clara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly not. Your wife will keep a tight rein upon you. She looks that
      sort. But I don't know why we should be talking in this strain the first
      time we have had a word together for&mdash;how many years? Four? Five? We
      have quickly dropped into old ways. But then you were a fire-eater, a
      chartered libertine, independent, a bird of freedom. Whereas now&mdash;my
      poor friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; cried Thornton, starting forward, with some excitement in his
      eyes that glowed in the dimness, &ldquo;don't fall into any delusion. If you
      think I am going the way of another poor friend of ours who can't call his
      soul his own, you are devilishly mistaken. I married because it happened
      to strike me that I wanted to do so. But I run the concern, and my wife's
      a sensible woman and recognises the fact. And whatever I want to do I am
      going to do. I have generally done it, and don't see why I should break
      through my habit now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she going to enjoy a beautiful independence likewise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It isn't good for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. You always were a delicate judge in things feminine. Did you
      ever read 'As You Like It'? 'Lock the door on your wife's wit and it will
      out at the casement.' Have a care, my friend. I am about the only woman
      you have tried to make a fool of and haven't succeeded, and so you perhaps
      have a kind of respect for my intelligence, and I give you warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I burned some of your letters the other day,&rdquo; said Thornton cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was wise. Suppose we go in. The act must be about commencing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The curtain was already up. Major Clavering was scanning the house
      drearily through a pair of opera glasses. Clytie was looking at the stage
      and thinking of her husband, wishing he would come in. When the door
      behind opened she turned round, and with an eye trained to catch fleeting
      expression, noticed a look upon Thornton's face,&mdash;the after-light, as
      it were, of a sneer, before the features had time to reset,&mdash;that she
      had never observed there before. The change from this to his usual gay
      smile was so rapid that she thought she had been mistaken, and attributed
      it to an illusion produced by the shadow at the back of the box. But the
      impression of it remained and it was unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next <i>entr'acte</i> the men went out, leaving Clytie and Mrs.
      Clavering alone together. Either through the mere social desire to please
      or through a feeling of compassion proceeding from conscious superiority,
      the elder woman sought to make an agreeable impression upon the young
      wife. But Clytie had wrapped herself up in a strange veil of reserve and
      her attitude was unpropitiatory. Mrs. Clavering's falsetto voice struck
      upon her nerves, the confident air of patronage irritated her. She longed
      to be away from the heavy, acrid atmosphere, the artificiality of the
      opera, the society of Mrs. Clavering. She felt self-conscious, was angry
      with herself. She had the keen feminine sense of a false position and
      longed for extrication. She was glad when her husband and Major Clavering
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been telling Mrs. Hammerdyke about old times in Cairo, and singing
      your praises,&rdquo; said Mrs. Clavering. &ldquo;Are you not grateful to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am flattered,&rdquo; said Thornton somewhat ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is always the way to make a man grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same with us. I don't suppose there is much difference in that
      respect between men and women,&rdquo; said Clytie, for the sake of saying
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Clavering; &ldquo;women can generally
      sift the grain from the chaff&mdash;only, poor things, they too often take
      the chaff by preference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you are not alluding to me, my dear,&rdquo; said the major, who was
      given to saying stupid things by way of showing that he followed the
      thread of his wife's conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton chimed in with his deep laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is one for you, Clavering. Perhaps one for me too. Anyhow, the
      curtain is going up and that saves us. Make room for me by you, Clytie,
      and tell me about what's going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He edged in his chair between Clytie and Mrs. Clavering. The major lounged
      behind, with his hands in his pockets, very much bored. He was hoping to
      escape soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you enjoying it?&rdquo; whispered Thornton to Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moderately. It is a dull opera. And it is so unbearably hot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not entrancingly interesting. Would you like to clear out after
      this act? I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Claverings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are a bit tired of it. Shall we all go back together to the hotel
      and have supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd sooner we were alone together, Thornton dear&mdash;this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a little gesture of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course we won't ask them if you don't want to. But then we must stay
      this thing out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back in his chair and looked at the mass of heads in the
      opposite tiers, vague in the dimness, and drummed with his fingers on the
      rails of his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; said Mrs. Clavering. &ldquo;That's one of your old tricks. You never seem
      to think that people have nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie caught the words, although they were whispered. She turned her head
      round quickly and stared at the stage for the rest of the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was over Mrs. Clavering solved the question of departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we all want to go,&rdquo; she said, rising. &ldquo;My husband is suffering
      acutely, and yours I know is not very musical. When shall we see you
      again, Mrs. Hammerdyke? Will you come and dine with us some evening,
      quietly&mdash;when we can talk better? I'll let you know what evenings we
      are free. Will that do? That is your wife's cloak, not mine, Mr.
      Hammerdyke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Thornton and Clytie were driving back to their hotel
      in the pleasant Paris victoria. It seemed a superb night. A slight breeze
      had risen, and the leaves in the Champs Elysées rustled pleasantly. Clytie
      leaned back with a sense of relief, physical and moral. They had both been
      rather silent since they left the opera house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let us go in,&rdquo; said Clytie suddenly. &ldquo;Let us drive about a little,
      along the quays&mdash;anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to suggest it,&rdquo; said Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the order to the coachman, who turned back through the Place de la
      Concorde and took them past the Tuileries and the great mass of the Louvre
      and along the quays in the direction of Auteuil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of the Clavering woman?&rdquo; asked Thornton. &ldquo;Not much,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say that I like her. Perhaps I oughtn't to say it, as she is a
      friend of yours, but&mdash;she doesn't please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I can't say that she does me now. She never was a beauty, but she
      has sadly fallen off the last few years. She thinks herself so deuced
      superior. And she isn't, by Jove! Still she is amusing, you know, and that
      is a quality that covers a multitude of sins. But other women can't
      understand her. She was loathed by them all in Cairo, so you are not alone
      in your antipathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Thornton drew her closer to his side and took
      her hand in his. Clytie felt somewhat hurt. It was not flattering to be
      grouped with the other women in Cairo, however estimable they may have
      been in their non-appreciation of Mrs. Clavering. They drove on, and began
      to talk of different subjects, disconnectedly, without much interest.
      Finally Thornton came back to the Claverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, I suppose you'll dine with them, as they were civil enough to
      ask us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, if you wish it and it gives you any pleasure. Perhaps I may
      like her better when I know more of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you can't drop people because you don't happen to take a violent
      fancy to them,&rdquo; he said rather lamely. And then he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had let me ask them to supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have livened us up a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it would,&rdquo; answered Clytie almost wearily. &ldquo;I half wish you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The evanescent charm had gone from the drive. The weather, too, had
      changed. Clouds, that had imperceptibly gathered, covered the moon. The
      quay looked desolate, the water black and lifeless, on the other side the
      great buildings loomed forbidding in the darkness. An air of
      disenchantment was over all things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will monsieur turn back? It is going to rain,&rdquo; said the cabman, lounging
      sideways and looking down at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned off through the narrow streets, on the nearest way back to the
      hotel. The cab horse was tired and jogged on painfully, indifferent to the
      loud-cracking whip and the &ldquo;<i>hue's</i>&rdquo; addressed to him in the driver's
      raucous voice. Clytie shivered a little at the sudden fall in the
      temperature. She was chilled too&mdash;ever so little&mdash;at her heart.
      She drew away slightly from her husband, who held her hand mechanically.
      When she withdrew it he did not seem to notice. He had discovered that he
      was annoyed about the supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the horse, overdriven, stumbled, tried to recover himself, and
      then crashed down helpless, snapping the shaft. The victoria lurched
      violently on the side where Clytie was sitting. To save herself she jumped
      out quickly, but her foot slipped on the kerb and she nearly fell.
      Thornton sprang out and raised her, and then turned to the coachman in a
      sudden frenzy of passion. He stood there moving his arms about and cursed
      him in English. Clytie was shocked to the heart. She was thankful that she
      could see his face but dimly in the bad gaslight. The cabman shrugged his
      shoulders as he bent down to loosen the traces. Some people came up,
      chiefly from a small <i>brasserie</i> whose few tables were just visible
      some yards further along the street. Another cab arrived and paused,
      interested and expectant, watching the scene: the little group round the
      fallen horse; the stately figure of the girl in white dress and rich
      opera-cloak standing by the upset cab; the great figure of the man,
      stamping with rage, pouring forth a torrent of oaths. It all happened very
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie touched her husband's arm quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Thornton,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He does not even understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton looked at her for a moment, then at the group. Then he burst into
      a loud laugh, pulled a ten-franc piece from his pocket and threw it to the
      cabman, who picked it up with an ironical, &ldquo;<i>Merci, bourgeois</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered the other cab and drove quickly homewards. Thornton seemed to
      have forgotten his rage, for he laughed in high spirits over the incident.
      He apologised gaily for his loss of temper and language. He was still
      infected with his years of savagery, he pleaded. He had been so accustomed
      to rule men by terror that he forgot himself sometimes. Often he had been
      the only white man among hundreds of fierce, lawless savages, over whom he
      had despotic authority of life and death. If they had not feared his rage
      and violence, his life would not have been worth a moment's purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had regained his old manner, the daring personal charm that had swept
      her along in spite of herself into marrying him. The glamour of his fame,
      his power, his heroism came over her and hid the sordid scenes of the
      evening. When they reached the hotel they were lovers once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Clytie alighted from the cab her foot gave way beneath her. It had been
      hurting her since her slip on the kerb, but she had scarcely noticed the
      pain. Now she found that she could not walk. She had sprained her ankle.
      She limped into the hotel with Thornton's aid. Then she stood at the foot
      of the stairs and looked at them helplessly. It was an old-fashioned
      hotel, without a lift, and their rooms were on the third story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll carry you up,&rdquo; said Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her up in his arms, and mounted the stairs with a step as light
      and springy as if he had no burden to carry. Until then Clytie had not
      realised his marvellous strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like the fairy princess being carried off by the giant,&rdquo; she
      whispered.

      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>lytie was confined
      several days to her room through her sprained ankle. It was not an
      unqualified affliction, as it solved the question of her dining with the
      Claverings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton went alone, carrying with him his wife's excuses and regrets, and
      returned to her in high spirits. When she was able to get about again the
      Claverings had left Paris for Homburg, where they were going to stay for a
      few weeks. &ldquo;And when they return to London we can see just as much or as
      little of them as we like,&rdquo; said Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forced confinement also brought Clytie a little more solitude than
      usual. Thornton found a race meeting or two to go to, and a nominally
      bachelor supper party, and he laughed, in his gay manner, at this
      resumption of bachelor habits. Clytie was rather glad, on the whole, to be
      left to her own society for a little. She was gradually awakening from the
      dream, realising herself. Very often in the ordinary, sober moments of
      life Thornton jarred upon her. His absence often was a relief. She hated
      herself when this unwelcome and unbidden thought came into her mind; but
      it came for all her hating. The sprained ankle marked definitely the end
      of this second or false honeymoon in Paris, whose glamour was the
      lingering twilight glow of the real one in Bordighera. It was then that
      Clytie first thought of the railway journey as a landmark. After her
      recovery Thornton continued his bachelor habits as a matter of course, and
      as a matter of course discontinued his playful apologies. Still he took
      Clytie whithersoever she expressed a desire to go, and gladly, proud of
      having his beautiful wife by his side. Only, if she elected to remain at
      home, he went out equally cheerfully by himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally they drove in the Bois in a neat phaeton and pair which he
      hired for her from a livery-stable, and he would point out to her the
      celebrities whom they passed by. Some of these she had herself met or seen
      at the various social functions to which they had received invitations.
      They themselves, too, had become known and were pointed out with some
      curiosity,&mdash;<i>le beau couple</i>, as the phrase went,&mdash;even by
      those who were unacquainted with their name or position. Thornton was
      always in his gayest humour on these occasions as he sat by his wife's
      side and guided his pair through the crush of magnificent equipages; and
      she felt glad too and elated, pleased by the vivid flashes of colouring in
      dresses and parasols, and the vague perfumes that filled the air, and the
      half-caught scraps of conversation and laughter. Her girlish delight at
      the gladness of life came back to her fresh and untainted. She indulged
      her old habit of speculation on the life that lay beneath individual
      faces, which she stored up in her memory for rapid sketching when at
      leisure, and she would draw Thornton into her vein, and then there were
      arguments without end. These were some of her happiest moments in Paris,
      when she recovered her old self, bright, satirical, paradoxical, and felt
      no cold hand on her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, towards the end of their stay in Paris, they had drawn up in the
      block of carriages by the side of the promenade. The sun was powerful, and
      the glaring colours in the carriages contrasted with the cool tones of
      white and gray in the deep shade under the chestnut-trees. Clytie was
      animatedly observing the bright scene when her eyes met those of a woman,
      quietly though expensively dressed, seated in an open carriage quite close
      by. For a moment they looked at one another in silent inquiry, and then
      came a flash of mutual recognition. It was the girl whom Clytie had met
      the summer before in the hotel at Dinan. The scene, with its mingled
      associations of wonder and pity, came back to her, and moved by a strong
      impulse she smiled and moved her head slightly. A look of eager wonderment
      came over the other's face as she returned Clytie's greeting. And then she
      turned quickly away to talk to a man who had just come up to the side of
      the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Clytie!&rdquo; cried Thornton, setting the horses in motion, &ldquo;you
      must really make sure who people are before you bow to them. Do you know
      who that woman is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;that is to say, I know what she is. I don't know her
      name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is one of the most notorious women in Paris, Loulou Mendès. You
      mustn't go playing the fool like this! What did you bow to her for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I know her&mdash;a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;know&mdash;her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Thornton dear; it is somewhat of a story. I met her accidentally
      last year in Dinan. She was in trouble, and I took a fancy for her, and
      seeing her suddenly here, I showed her that I recognised her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sincerely hope you won't do such a thing again,&rdquo; he said shortly,
      giving a vicious cut to the horses that sent them spinning down the <i>allée</i>.
      &ldquo;And please to remember that you are not an amateur Bohemian any longer,
      but my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Thornton, you mustn't say things like that!&rdquo; said Clytie, with a
      queer little catch at her throat. &ldquo;They hurt me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you mustn't deserve them,&rdquo; replied Thornton. And then, mollifying
      at the sight of her distress: &ldquo;You don't understand these things, little
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind, dear,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;Perhaps it was foolish of me. I
      ought to have considered you; I didn't think of it. She kissed my hand the
      last time I saw her, and it would have seemed base and hypocritical to
      have cut her dead to-day. It seemed such a little matter. Why hurt the
      girl's feelings? That's why I did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feelings?&rdquo; echoed Thornton, with a laugh. &ldquo;Bah! my good child, you are
      talking nonsense. She put her feelings up the spout years ago to get
      herself champagne and diamonds and the rest of it. With her soul sold to
      the devil and her body to men, what the deuce is she going to do with
      feelings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I saw of her was very human, Thornton. And if such women are brutes,
      it is men who make them so. If men were only kinder and tenderer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the sentimental idiot in 'Jenny.' That's a poem about it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Rossetti; I am very fond of it,&rdquo; she replied, with a half
      smile, wondering somewhat at his explanation. Then she added: &ldquo;But surely
      there's humanity in every human being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a very sweet, innocent belief, and you had better keep to it, my
      dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Thornton, I'm not an ignorant little schoolgirl,&rdquo; she said, with hurt
      vanity. &ldquo;I have learned something of the world. Perhaps I have been too
      eager to acquaint myself with things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, you can't know much about them,&rdquo; he replied shortly. &ldquo;Leave such
      things alone. They don't concern you, so what's the good of prying into
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have concerned me,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Believe me, Thornton, it was
      something deeper than ordinary morbid curiosity that led me to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't see what the deuce the Social Question has to do with girls,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;That is what licks me. What the dickens has it got to do with
      your life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you mistake, Thornton,&rdquo; she replied eagerly, with a return of her old
      earnestness. &ldquo;It is not the Social Question. Indeed not. I never have any
      call to look at things in that aspect. I am neither a sociologist nor a
      reformer. I am an artist. I have to express certain truths about human
      beings,&mdash;the little talent I have lies entirely that way,&mdash;and
      in order to express the truths I had to set to work to learn them. How all
      this corruption affects society, how it is to be done away with and so on,
      does not come within my province. But to get to the hearts and inner
      feelings of individuals, to see how society affects them, what
      justification they have in their struggle with it, how they contemplate
      life, what elements of emotion, or passion, or weariness, or what not form
      essential parts of their beings that do not form essential parts of mine&mdash;to
      try to do that, Thornton, <i>has</i> been my business, and, till I knew
      you, was the dearest motive of my life. Don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when you have done it what good will it do to yourself or anybody
      else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To answer you I should have to appear conceited. It would be answering
      the question, What is the good of art at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all said and done, what is the good of it? To make pretty and
      amusing things to look at. All the rest is cant and humbug&mdash;including
      your desire to scrape acquaintance with loose women for artistic purposes.
      Look here, little wife&rdquo;&mdash;and he turned round, with a sharp smile that
      showed his white teeth more than usual&mdash;&ldquo;I didn't fall in love with
      you because you were an artist and held highfalutin' theories about
      artistic ideals and so forth, but because you were the woman whose
      loveliness appealed to me and always fascinated me. And now you are my
      wife you have other things to think about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, Thornton,&rdquo; she replied, staring a little wistfully in front
      of her. &ldquo;Tell me. What is our new life going to be like? You speak so
      little of it that I scarcely know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what's the good of worrying yourself about it yet? I'll tell you when
      the time comes. You'll have our position in society to look after, keep
      things going straight for me in quarters where a woman can wheedle out
      more in an hour than a man in a twelvemonth. I have definitely taken up
      politics, you know. Things were settled this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why didn't you tell me before?&rdquo; she cried involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought of it, my dear. Well, Hernshawe has asked me whether I
      would care to be his private secretary. His present man is in the Civil
      Service and is resigning owing to some office promotion, so when the House
      meets after the Whitsuntide recess Hernshawe will be free to take me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite understand,&rdquo; said Clytie, to whom these details were all
      new. She was vaguely aware that Thornton had intentions of aiming at a
      parliamentary career, but as he had volunteered no confidences, she had
      shrunk from soliciting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;why you should take a
      private-secretaryship. You want to enter Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. But I am so out of things that I want to get into training, so
      to speak. I shall be this session, perhaps next, with Hernshawe and learn
      all the ropes, and then he will run me for a suitable vacancy. It is as
      simple as good-morning, as they say in this country. I must do something,
      and politics seem about the only mildly exciting thing to go in for in
      this severely flat and respectable continent. But beyond looking after the
      society side of the matter, I don't see why you need worry your pretty
      head about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't you want me to become a bit of a politician, so as to help
      you, and understand you in your career?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, to a certain extent,&rdquo; he replied with cheerful
      offhandedness. &ldquo;But for God's sake, my dear child, don't become a
      political woman. If there's one kind of a woman I bar more than another,
      its the female politician. Of course you'll have to go round canvassing
      for votes at the election, and to humbug people in society, but all that
      is rather sport than otherwise? Never mind, little wife; you'll have a
      ripping good time in London when the show begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, in gay good humour again. Clytie echoed with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thornton,&rdquo; she said after a short pause, &ldquo;I don't want to bother you
      about politics if you don't like it&rdquo;&mdash;she felt now a strange
      hesitation in speaking to him&mdash;&ldquo;but you know you'll have to convert
      me, dear. It has been on my mind for some time. You are a Tory, you know,
      and I have been a Radical hitherto in feelings and sympathies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He burst out laughing at her little air of seriousness. Perhaps if he had
      known how he hurt her, he would not have treated the matter so cavalierly.
      This difference in political views had been a question of some concern to
      Clytie, who was aware of old-fashioned Tory prejudices. And Thornton took
      her Radicalism as a jest, attributing no importance to the difference of
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll change when we get back and become a shining light in the Primrose
      League.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was too depressed by the whole of the foregoing conversation to pursue
      the subject any further. Thornton started the lighter topic of personal
      criticism of their new acquaintances in Paris, and rattled on in great
      spirits. He had forgotten entirely the argument that Clytie's somewhat
      unconventional action had occasioned, and was as boyishly gay as ever. But
      men forget things much more easily than women, especially when they have
      no object in remembering, nor any reminiscent twinge of susceptibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Clytie spent alone. Thornton was dining at the Café des
      Ambassadeurs with some men from the Embassy. He had kissed her before he
      started, called himself a selfish brute for condemning her to a dull
      evening, and went away humming a café-concert air. She did not mind his
      leaving her, took it now as a matter of course that each should be to a
      certain extent independent of the other; for the glamour of the south had
      departed, and the practicalities of life had begun to assert themselves.
      But it was the first wretched evening of her married life. She would have
      liked to cry, but as she was not of those who cry easily, she sat with
      eyes all the more painful for being strained and tearless. She had
      received a great shock. Ever since she had rebelled against the Durdleham
      formula that men were to descend from their intellectual sublimity when
      they spoke to women, lest like Semele the latter should be consumed in the
      Jovian blaze, she had been accustomed to meet men freely on an
      intellectual level. To find herself in a society where this particular
      formula was unknown had been one of the earliest joys of her emancipated
      life. She had very little vanity in the matter of her own attainments, but
      she took it for granted that her associates should recognise in her a
      woman of ordinary culture, capable of forming rational opinions. Her
      intelligence was keen, her judgment fine. She had read, thought, observed.
      Her art was to a certain extent a matter of intellect as well as of
      instinctive feeling, and in this respect had been stimulated by her
      intercourse with Kent. In the glow of her young, ardent nature she had
      committed many extravagances, but they all had borne the indubitable stamp
      of a mind strenuous in its endeavours. None but fools had ever thought of
      condescending to Clytie because she was a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now for the first time she was coolly shown that she was a woman, that
      her opinions were not worth serious consideration, that she must not
      trouble her pretty-head about things that were too deep for her. And by
      the man, above all, whose life she shared. They were hours of dull, dazed
      humiliation that she spent alone that evening; hours that were not lost
      even in the pain of her after life. Over the absence of sympathy with her
      own pursuits she was only a little regretful. It would have been nicer if
      Thornton had been able to take a pleasure in her art. But she was too
      large-natured not to be able to bridge over this small gap between them.
      She was ready to sacrifice her art entirely to her love, was eager to
      throw herself into his interests and ambitions. But she demanded a full,
      vigorous share. To live an empty life was with her an impossibility. And
      to this life Thornton, in his good-natured contempt for her powers, was
      condemning her. She was puzzled, humiliated, frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a vague mystery of woe in the dawn of a dreary day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Thornton was enjoying himself amazingly. The dinner was one
      which, as Heine says, &ldquo;ought to be partaken of kneeling,&rdquo; and the wine was
      excellent; the party well chosen, the talk essentially, broadly masculine.
      There is a certain type of man whose conversation is wholly made up of
      sport in its various aspects, women, shop, and crude personal gossip&mdash;a
      type which numbers its tens of thousands in English society. It can be met
      with, to utter weariness of the soul, in any heterogeneous gathering of
      upper- and middle-class Britons. They are God's creatures, it is true;
      many of them are possessed of estimable qualities, some of them have
      performed deeds of heroism. But as a type they are a glaring satire upon
      the vaunted culture and refinement of our civilisation. And it is a
      remarkable thing how little their power and influence are recognised by
      writers in their analysis of the spirit of this dying nineteenth century.
      This vast overwhelming type does not read, does not think, does not care
      for art or music, has no power of penetration to the heart of delicate
      things. It is dull, brawny, selfish, and a pillar of the Church and State.
      Its main subjective characteristic is the brutality of its views
      concerning women&mdash;varying from the kindly disdain of its highest
      members to the degraded brutality of its lowest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this type, with all his physical charm, his brilliant personality and
      splendid capacities for action, was Thornton Hammerdyke. The man whose
      magnetism had drawn Clytie irresistibly, headlong into his arms was only,
      after all, a representative of this ignoble, commonplace order of men. The
      love that had flooded Clytie's being with wild surging tumult was only,
      after all, the commonplace, ignoble passion of his type. There are some
      things so elementary that analysis quickly comes to an end. Put in a strip
      of litmus paper and it is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was honestly glad to be free of Clytie. With unconscious cynicism he
      never sought to disguise it from himself. With Carteret of the Hussars and
      Swithin and Holyoake of the Embassy he was in his proper sphere. They were
      of the type. He had interests in common with them. The fact that he was a
      man of high distinction was neither here nor there. Over the fish and <i>entrées</i>
      they talked of racing and shooting; over the game they wandered along the
      upper galleries of the Cloaca Maxima of Paris; over the peaches and
      Château-Mouton they told foul stories. An ignoble, commonplace dinner
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Clytie was alone in her room at the hotel staring at an unknown
      future.

      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he last three days
      of their stay in Paris were marked by a return on the part of Thornton to
      his old devotion. He declined invitations ruthlessly, spent almost the
      whole of his time with his wife. In all outward and visible signs they
      were lovers again, but the inward and spiritual grace was a bit vapoury.
      They went on excursions together, to Fontainebleau, Melun, Passy. One day
      they wandered about the forest of Vincennes and he kissed her beneath the
      trees as he used to do at Bordighera. They had gay, laughing meals
      together at little riverside restaurants. He was passionate in his
      expressions of endearment and in his delight at her beauty. With the
      negative tact of passion, he avoided all subjects that could jar upon her.
      For three days he was the Thornton of their honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie at first could not understand this sudden change. She asked him the
      reason tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you see, you silly girl,&rdquo; he replied with masterful frankness,
      &ldquo;that I love you and we have only three more days' idleness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she let the spell come over her again and surrendered herself to
      his mood. But now, instead of entering with spontaneous joy a world of
      laughter whose magic gates lay open before her, she crossed the threshold
      with deliberate step. She had to choose whether to laugh or cry. She was
      young, she wanted to love her husband; so she chose to laugh. It was an
      act of reason. But woe to love when reason has to find its argument!
    </p>
    <p>
      By Whitsuntide they were in London, installed in their house in the
      Cromwell Road. The three days' passion had cooled down, and the atmosphere
      was colder than before. But Clytie for several weeks was so busy that she
      had not time for much consideration of troubling questions. First, the
      house required her attention. There was much supplementary furniture to be
      chosen, many minor schemes of decoration to be carried out in accordance
      with her own artistic tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton gave her a free hand in these matters, and, beyond taking it for
      granted that the house should be fitly arranged, never troubled himself
      about details. He attended two or three picture sales with Clytie, where
      he bought a few pictures on her recommendation, ordered some great leather
      armchairs for his smoking-room, and then transferred his attention to
      concerns of more serious interest. So Clytie, left unhampered, succeeded
      in arranging the house to her own satisfaction. This occupied a great
      portion of her time; the rest was almost entirely devoted to her social
      duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself in some small position in society, as the artistic wife
      of a distinguished soldier of fortune with a considerable income, and it
      was Thornton's special ambition for the time being that this position
      should be maintained and secured, in furtherance of his own personal
      projects. Whilst contemplating marriage, or rather after he had, in his
      fierce impetuous way, decided upon it, he had sought around after some
      practical interest in his new life. He had forsworn Africa, with a
      virtuous sense of self-sacrifice. What remained worthy of a man's serious
      attention? He did not consult Clytie. It scarcely occurred to him that the
      subject concerned her. Of the few careers that presented themselves he
      selected two, the turf and politics, and wavered for some time in his
      choice. At last he tossed up for it, as he had often done at the fork of
      two paths in the forest. The coin came down with the Queen's head
      uppermost&mdash;and that meant politics. He was a Tory of the fiercer
      school. Even if family and professional tradition had not influenced him,
      a lengthy course of despotic authority enforced by the halter and the butt
      end of a musket is not favourable to the cultivation of Liberal suavities
      and amenities. And again, the &ldquo;type&rdquo; is almost always Tory. He was even
      out of touch with the broader Conservativism of our day, between which and
      modern Liberalism he failed to appreciate the distinction. In fact his
      political ideals, such as they were, belonged to the beginning instead of
      the end of the century, but he expressed them with a fervour that left no
      doubt as to their genuineness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no difficulty in setting at work the machinery of social influence,
      and the result was the offer of a private-secretaryship on the part of an
      under-secretary of state. He accepted it. It would not only afford him an
      insight into the practical working of politics, but would give him an
      opportunity of making himself known to the chiefs of the Conservative
      party and securing their influence when he should seek to enter
      Parliament. When everything was settled he informed Clytie casually in
      Paris of his new ambitions. She, too, had wondered what outlet this man of
      restless action would find for his energies, and, shrinking from inquiry,
      had been filled with vague uneasiness. Now she felt that he had made a
      worthy choice and in spite of dubious encouragement strove to identify
      herself with his interests. True, she contemplated with a little dismay
      the abandonment of her own pet social theories, which tended towards an
      advanced and somewhat inchoate Radicalism, and the espousal of a cause
      forming part of a scheme of life against which she had so passionately
      rebelled. But she wilfully, almost desperately, shut her eyes against all
      this. She would give her heart and soul to Thornton's glory, and the
      sacrifice of principle on her part would only accentuate the triumph. But
      this sacrifice Thornton did not concern himself to realise. Very few men
      ever do. As we have seen, he laughed at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered upon his political duties as soon as they returned to London,
      led a busy life of work and pleasure, throwing into both the energy of his
      strong vitality. He was not a man to wait. Social position, power, must be
      wrested from the world by force of arms. The sooner the struggle began and
      the fiercer it was fought the sooner would come success. It behoved
      Clytie, therefore, to enter upon it with him at once. Before she could
      realise herself as mistress of a large house, as cut off from the old
      habits that had invested London with earnest charm, as sundered from Kent
      and Winifred, as deprived of her art and her dreams and ambition, she
      found herself caught up in the whirl of London society, bidden to
      cultivate its conventions, flatter its weaknesses, intrigue, gossip,
      dance, drive, rush, without a moment's pause to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus began her new life. It was not the one she had dreamed of. In
      fact she hardly recognised herself in her deliberate subordination to a
      nature dominating hers. She let herself drift, abandoning herself to the
      current, clutching hold of her love towards her husband as the only plank
      saving her from destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred she saw occasionally. She had no time for anything beyond a half
      hour's gossip, and then she forgot her own hopes and fears in the
      happiness of her friend, who had just become engaged to Treherne. She saw
      nothing of Kent. A feeling she could not analyse restrained her from
      writing to him, ever so formally. It was analogous to the whimsical
      shrinking from sketching his portrait when she had first met him. She
      heard of him, however, through Winifred. He came down to the studio still
      occasionally, and chatted over the teacups&mdash;&ldquo;chiefly about you,
      dear,&rdquo; said Winifred, &ldquo;and the old days and your present life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is he changed at all?&rdquo; asked Clytie. &ldquo;It seems centuries since those
      same old days. I feel almost like asking whether he has a gray head and
      carries his years well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem a long time,&rdquo; said Winifred reflectively. &ldquo;But it really
      isn't, you know, and Kent is just the same as ever. His trip abroad has
      done him so much good. Do you know, dear, except Victor&mdash;and Mr.
      Hammerdyke, of course&mdash;I think he is the best man in all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her brown cheeks flushed as she spoke, and Clytie bent down and kissed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Winnie darling, I wish everybody were as true and loyal as you,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great sob was in her heart, and she would have given much to have buried
      her face in Winnie's lap and let the tears come how they would. But she
      mastered herself, and before the other had time to hear the echo of the
      chord that was struck she went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Winnie, how is his great work getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rapidly, I believe,&rdquo; answered Winifred. &ldquo;He seems to have nothing else to
      live for now. I think he misses you, dear, and plunges into it as a kind
      of consolation. He has had a great compliment paid him&mdash;have you
      heard? He met a great Austrian scientist, Herr &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      I can't remember his name&mdash;it doesn't matter. Anyhow, he showed this
      professor his work, and talked to him about the difficulties of
      publishing, expense, and all that, and a few days ago he received an offer
      from the University of Vienna to translate what was already done into
      German and publish it there. He says it is a most distinguished honour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad, dear,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;I feel proud of him, and I wish I
      could see him&mdash;to give him my congratulations. You will tell him that
      I asked after him, won't you, Winnie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course!&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;Don't we always talk of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blather was anxious that Clytie and her husband should come to
      Durdleham to stay there after the season in town was over. But Clytie
      replied evasively to the affectionate invitation. She shrank from
      Durdleham even more than from herself. Mrs. Blather, now that the soreness
      as regards the wedding had worn off, was delighted at the brilliant match&mdash;just
      the very marriage one could have wished for Clytie, as she remarked over
      the Durdleham tea tables. Besides, it was definite settling down for
      Clytie, saving them from that shadow of scandal that had always seemed
      liable to be cast over them through her unprincipled behaviour. There were
      no longer any fears. And Mrs. Blather had her own little triumph in
      another way. She remembered now she had prophesied years ago that Clytie's
      desire to live her art life in London was a craze that would not last long&mdash;like
      Janet's transient enthusiasm for cookery classes. Both Janet and herself
      took it for granted that Clytie viewed her past errors with the same
      indulgent retrospective smile, and wrote her complacent letters based on
      this assumption. And Clytie found it harder than ever to write to them
      naturally, to answer these letters in the same tone. If her sisters had
      failed to understand her when to her her young, earnest self was brightly
      intelligible, how could they do it now when she saw herself vaguely,
      dimly, wrapped in impenetrable vapours? A visit to Durdleham, under the
      circumstances, seemed almost an ordeal. Yet Thornton's presence there
      might make some difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to him very little on the subject. He broached it himself one
      day at breakfast, almost the only time now, except late at night, that she
      saw him alone. It was nearing the end of July and the session of
      Parliament was on the eve of closing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going to see your people, Clytie?&rdquo; he asked, looking over
      his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I had told you. They want us to come for a week as soon as we
      can leave town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; won't you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, thanks. It would not suit me at all. You go and make an excuse
      for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things are not gay there, I know,&rdquo; said Clytie, &ldquo;but I should like you to
      come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be done, my dear,&rdquo; replied Thornton. &ldquo;You had better have a
      quiet time there by yourself, while I go up to Scotland&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would have liked me to go to Scotland with you&mdash;we
      have seen so little of each other lately. You don't want to stay up there
      all the autumn without me?&rdquo; she added half pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear Clytie, you can come if you like,&rdquo; said her husband, drawing
      back his chair from the table. &ldquo;Only you won't find much fun in a little
      shooting-box in the middle of a glen in the Highlands. Look: you go and
      see your people for a month, and then, if you like, you can come and join
      me there&mdash;that is to say, if Carteret has any of his women folks
      staying in the house, which does not seem to be quite settled yet. If he
      hasn't, naturally you can't come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I shall not go to Durdleham&mdash;I couldn't. You would not
      understand why. I shall stay in London, and mind the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should not like you to do that,&rdquo; said Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I had rather you did not,&rdquo; he repeated, with a gathering frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long do you contemplate being away?&rdquo; asked Clytie quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;August and September, perhaps&mdash;I can't quite tell yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you propose, then, that I should go and stay in Durdleham for two
      months with my people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not contemplated it, but he was irritated at her show of
      opposition. He lost his temper and said sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Or with any other friends you like. I am not going to have you
      remain here all by yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me your reasons, Thornton?&rdquo; asked Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crumpled up his paper angrily and thumped it on the table. The veins in
      his forehead stood out. His face grew ugly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I say a thing is to be done I mean it,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and I am not
      accustomed to be asked for my reasons!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall leave you until you have recovered yourself,&rdquo; said Clytie with
      dignity, and she left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first real quarrel between them. The blood had often rushed
      hot through Clytie's veins and set her pulses tingling, but hitherto she
      had restrained herself, feeling that the first revolt would mark the
      beginning of the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed a miserable day. When Thornton came home in the afternoon to
      dress for dinner he was in one of his light-hearted moods. He had backed
      an outsider some weeks back at very long odds. The race had been run that
      day and the outsider had won, bringing him a couple of thousand pounds&mdash;a
      windfall that relieved him of certain temporary embarrassments. Hence his
      buoyancy that afternoon. He had apparently forgotten the morning's
      difference, and called Clytie &ldquo;little wife&rdquo; again, and promised her a
      victoria to supplement the modest brougham with which they had begun. He
      put his arm round her and kissed her, praised her beautiful hair, the
      roundness of her arms, her dress. He told her the gossip of the day in his
      bright off-hand manner, made her laugh in spite of her weariness. But when
      he kissed her she shrank a little. In the elation of his victory he did
      not notice her lack of responsiveness; besides, he was not over-sensitive
      at any time. When they returned home at night from the dinner-party to
      which they had gone together, Thornton was still in pleasant mood. Nothing
      more was said respecting the plans for August and September.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reconciliation did not last long. Clytie strove with an earnestness
      that was torture to keep the peace between them, but sometimes her nature
      clamoured within her and broke out in self-assertion. Only four months
      married, and already the breach between them was perceptible, slowly
      widening. And it was Clytie that drifted away from her husband. If she had
      been a lesser nature, she might have retained the love on both sides. A
      woman of a lower type would have been able to flatter, soothe, cajole,
      yield, and thus have kept Thornton at her feet. The patronising contempt
      for her own needs, which lashed Clytie to the soul, she would have treated
      lightly, as the natural and foolish vanity of the superior being; and she
      would have found in a sudden demonstration of passion full compensation
      for previous indifference. But Clytie was not only unversed herself in the
      arts of seduction, but despised them fiercely in other women. And she
      began also to dread Thornton's fits of affection as much as his fits of
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her one morning quivering with mortification and suppressed
      bitterness. He himself was not conscious of the slight he had inflicted,
      and he went away in gay spirits. Their talk had turned upon a Cabinet
      Minister named Godderich, whose influence Thornton was anxious to acquire.
      Now it had so happened that this same Godderich had succeeded in making
      himself vastly obnoxious to Clytie. She told her husband this, giving him
      the reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not been accustomed to that kind of admiration,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
      don't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Thornton laughed his great laugh, called her &ldquo;his unconventional
      prude,&rdquo; and went on to show her what an invaluable ally Godderich was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must swallow your dislike, Clytie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, God bless my soul,
      if ninety-nine women out of a hundred had that chance, they would get the
      eyes out of his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you so much desire me to be like ninety-nine women out of a
      hundred, then, Thornton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Clytie; you know what I mean. Come! Don't you see that
      here's a way of pushing things on a bit? What does it matter if the ass is
      attentive? You can laugh at him. But keep him in hand a bit until we want
      to let him loose. Do you see? Of course I trust you, and all that sort of
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for your confidence,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;But I don't think you
      will need to exercise it much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind. Do you really want me, Thornton, to encourage this man to
      make love to me, so as to get a hold on him for other purposes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anyone like you for the dotting of i's,&rdquo; said Thornton,
      amused. &ldquo;But that's about the size of it. Don't you see what an infernal
      ass we can make of him? Well, think it over, little wife. Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the front door,&mdash;this little conversation had taken place
      in the hall,&mdash;and ran down the steps very well pleased with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Clytie's heart turned from him and she passed a wretched day&mdash;all
      the more trying as she felt in honour bound to sing antistrophe of praise
      of Thornton to the strophe of Mrs. Farquharson, with whom she was
      lunching.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening they were going out together. He came home late from
      Westminster, dressed hurriedly, and went down to the drawing-room, where
      Clytie was waiting. She was wearing a low-cut dress. Her arms were bare. A
      tiny diamond clasp to a thin gold chain flashed on her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove! You're looking lovelier than ever!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Come, let me kiss
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her to him, kissed the upper part of her arm, and then her lips.
      But she made no response. She shrank, and this time he noted it. His arm
      still round her waist, he held back his head and looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with loverlike reproach, and kissed her again, and again she
      shrank. And then he cast her aside roughly, and stamped his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it! Clytie,&rdquo; he exclaimed, showing his teeth, &ldquo;you are a perfect
      icicle!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie made no reply, but turned to the window and buttoned her glove.
      Thornton rang the bell violently, and when the footman appeared asked him
      why the devil the carriage had not come round. Then he flung himself into
      a chair and turned over a book. And thus they remained without speaking
      until the brougham was announced. On their way to their dinner-party they
      did not speak. He was in a fit of furious sulks, and Clytie's heart was
      too heavy. Afterwards he went off to his club and she drove home by
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this at the end of only four months' wedded life. What would it be at
      the end of four years, fourteen? Clytie strove for a little to blame
      herself for supersensitiveness, egotism, coldness. But her self rose in
      arms against this charge. For, like the unfolding of a horrible story, the
      nature of Thornton's love for her, the nature of the place she really
      occupied in his estimation, gradually broke upon her. The meaning of light
      remarks, trivial jests, careless actions; the meaning of caresses now half
      contemptuous, now passionate&mdash;all came to her in full light, in all
      their crudity, out of the gray darkness in which she had instinctively
      kept it hidden from herself. She stared at it&mdash;not in ignorant
      surmise as she had done in Paris, but with a ghastly sickening of soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the degradation of it! What was she to her husband but a possession, a
      toy, a woman, to suffer his caresses when it so pleased him to bestow
      them, a mistress whom he had taken it into his head to bind legally to
      himself, so that she might serve certain purposes of his in society? What
      little better was she to him than the women whom men buy,&mdash;Loulou
      Mendès, for instance,&mdash;save that he reckoned,&mdash;he had told her
      so,&mdash;on her fidelity to him? Things she had tried to ascribe to the
      careless familiarity of love blazed insultingly before her, scorching her,
      making her writhe in her abasement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Naturally satiety had come to him. He was indifferent whether he saw her
      or not for a season. Only in his absence she was to obey blindly his
      caprices. If only she was his wife, she thought bitterly, in the humdrum
      Durdleham way, where at least she would have had the conventional position
      in their conjugal relations! Either that or the wild independence of a
      Loulou Mendès, carrying her will in her hand, free to choose her own way
      among the groves of the satyrs. For even there the free path smells
      sweeter than the one of servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the session ended Clytie came to a definite understanding with
      her husband. It is surprising what pain can underlie this mutual
      adjustment of two intelligences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was again the breakfast-room. Each was reading the morning's
      correspondence. Thornton tossed a letter across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carteret's women folk can't come,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Devilish sensible women&mdash;they
      don't see the fun of it. So it's settled. I go up as soon as this wretched
      grind is over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Clytie calmly. &ldquo;I hope you will have a good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he replied in his careless way. &ldquo;It will be like old times
      again. And you will put in a good, quiet couple of months with your
      people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie bit her lip. Her heart beat a little faster. She was going to set
      herself in opposition to him. She glanced at him before she spoke; he
      hardly seemed to expect an answer, but continued reading another letter.
      He looked kind and frank, she thought, a husband for any woman to be proud
      of. In his morning freshness, clean-shaven, groomed, trimmed, he seemed
      handsomer than ever. His close brown hair had not a touch of gray;
      scarcely a line showed on his forehead or beneath his eyes; and the dark
      rich colour was visible beneath the bronze on his cheek. He broke into a
      laugh, buoyant and careless, over his letter, and looked up at Clytie.
      Then, his glance meeting hers, his face grew more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you gazing at me for with those great blue eyes of yours,
      Clytie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent forward, rested her cheek on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In regard to what you have just said&mdash;my going to Durdleham&mdash;I
      am not going for many reasons. I told you so, Thornton, the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite aware of it,&rdquo; said Thornton. &ldquo;But you are going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked her full in the face, and she returned his gaze calmly and
      unflinchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let us quarrel, Thornton,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is so sordid and petty.
      Let us try quietly to understand one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His glance fell first, and he threw himself back in his chair with a laugh
      and unfolded his paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;we'll bar scenes. Only don't say anything too severe or
      you'll spoil my breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thornton,&rdquo; she said, not changing her attitude, &ldquo;I think I know what my
      duty is towards you, and I try to perform it. Has it ever struck you that
      you may have some duties towards me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say it has,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you understand me, Thornton. I will try to make it clearer
      to you. As far as you will let me take an interest in your life, I do so.
      I am more than willing to make any sacrifices&mdash;to give up everything
      for you. But when you do not want me, as this autumn, I surely may
      remember that I have a life of my own to lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And suppose that life does not suit me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the point, Thornton. If you wished me, out of love for you, to do
      anything, I would do it. But this is a matter in which love has no place.
      Provided I am scrupulous in all my duties towards you, I have a right to
      my own life, to my own antipathies, to my own favourite pursuits&mdash;in
      fact to myself as an individual, and it is your duty towards me to
      recognise it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite see what you are driving at,&rdquo; said Thornton. &ldquo;You can
      dislike sweet champagne and paint pictures and read Schopenhauer if you
      like. Who is preventing you? But in certain matters, as you are my wife,
      you have got to do what I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take an extreme case, by way of argument: Suppose the fancy seized you
      to order me to remain in my bedroom all day&mdash;you would expect me to
      obey you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! I should think I would!&rdquo; cried Thornton, starting to his feet,
      with blazing eyes and the veins standing out on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems, Thornton,&rdquo; she said very quietly, &ldquo;you have married the wrong
      woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she rose, too, from the table, moved towards him, and laid her hand
      on his arm. He shook it off with an impatient oath, and turned away,
      fuming, to stare out of the window. She was too well accustomed to his
      fits of passion to resent the indignity. She mechanically picked off some
      withering leaves from some flowers on the mantelpiece, and waited for him
      to speak. At last he turned round again, and asked her sullenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any other pretty remarks to make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will listen to them quietly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want? I grant I was a fool to marry you. Let me hear
      the consequences of my folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face was set in a sneer, an ugly expression. She had seen it several
      times since that evening at the opera in Paris. The tears sprang into her
      eyes as she glanced at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't speak and look like that!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I cannot bear it. I did
      not intend to say anything hard just now. I only meant that you had
      mistaken me, and my needs, and my nature. I have tried to look upon
      marriage from your point of view for four months, and I can't do it any
      longer. You say I must obey you blindly in everything, even your arbitrary
      fancies, subordinate myself absolutely to you. Thornton, believe me, where
      your interests or love are concerned I will do it; but where they are not
      I can't, and it will be happier for both of us that I should tell you so
      frankly. If you go your way alone, I must go mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you set yourself in defiance to my wishes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie checked an impulse of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you won't understand me, and insist on putting it that way&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other for some time. And then Thornton ground his
      teeth and glared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go your own way if you like, but I warn you one of these days
      there will be the devil to pay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he strode out of the room, cursing, and slammed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie sat down by the window. The tears would come in spite of her pride.
      She had gained the victory. But there are some victories that have all the
      aching sense of defeat.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the day after
      this conversation Clytie was surprised by an announcement from Durdleham
      that Mrs. Blather and Janet were suddenly coming to town and would avail
      themselves of her often repeated invitation to pay her a visit in her new
      home. Janet had been ailing for some time past. The over-refined Davenant
      blood had never been vivifying at any time, and now, as there were sudden
      dangers of a grave kind, their Durdleham doctor had advised her consulting
      a London specialist. They hurried to catch the great man before he left
      for his summer holidays. That was their apology to Clytie for the
      shortness of their notice. Ordinarily on their rare visits to town they
      put up at Durfey's Hotel in Albany Street. Their father and grandfather
      had put up there from time immemorial, and they spoke of Durfey's with
      solemn familiarity, as if it were the one hotel of London. On this
      occasion, however, they came and stayed with Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their presence in the house was a relief to her, even though it was by way
      of counter-irritation. Thornton showed himself in the light of a charming
      host and delighted his sisters-in-law. They could not find enough
      felicitations to bestow upon Clytie. They forgot the old
      misunderstandings, took it for granted that Clytie had finally settled,
      was happy, without any ulterior desires. They went round the house, Mrs.
      Blather manifesting mild enthusiasm over the more solid arrangements in
      the way of furniture and domestic appurtenances, Janet going into little
      ecstasies over the decorations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought you had such a talent for house management,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Blather after an inspection of the linen-cupboards and china-closets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think it requires absolute genius,&rdquo; replied Clytie, &ldquo;to see that
      sheets are folded up properly and that plates are not put away dirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said her sister, with a philosophic sigh. &ldquo;So many young wives are
      so inexperienced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a delight to Mrs. Blather to see Clytie in this aspect. She could
      talk to her now on common ground; Clytie had become an ordinary sensible
      woman, who could discuss the things that fill the ordinary sensible
      woman's life: housemaids, fancywork, and the price of fish. Mrs. Blather
      knew that Hammerdyke was fairly well off, but she thought it her duty to
      give Clytie many valuable hints as to household expenditure, to which
      Clytie listened with suave distraction. She also gave her recipes for
      cooking, and the washing of lace, and infallible methods for removing wine
      stains from tablecloths; also neat little formulas for the management of a
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But yours is simply perfect,&rdquo; she added, with reference to this last.
      &ldquo;Oh, Clytie, you are a lucky girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Clytie there was something pathetically humorous in the aspect she
      presented to her sisters; in finding herself, for the first time in her
      life, perfect in their eyes; in their changed relations. It was amusing to
      be the lady of the house, and to make plans for Gracie and Janet's
      entertainment. She brightened under the sense of it, and though many a
      misconception on their part caused her a sharp twinge of pain, she allowed
      them to purr on contentedly, taking a small measure of enjoyment from the
      comfort thereof. Besides, she felt that it would not last long. Their stay
      was limited to three days. A week of it would have been intolerable. For
      this reason she declined to accompany them back to Durdleham. At first
      Mrs. Blather was rather hurt at her refusal; but Clytie gently smoothed
      over the matter, tactfully avoiding to give specific reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Thornton was amenity itself in his intercourse with Clytie when
      they met in her sisters' presence, in their private relations he showed a
      certain soreness&mdash;the result of the process of understanding. She
      tried to heal this, to win back from him, if not love, at least gentleness
      and courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thank you, Thornton, for being so nice to my sisters,&rdquo; she said
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I know how to behave myself in my own house,&rdquo; he replied
      coldly, and Clytie retired, and listened, with an ache in her heart, to
      Mrs. Blather's epithalamion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still it comforted her to see Thornton his old bright self again, as she
      had known him before her marriage, even though she knew his brow would
      darken on the departure of her guests. It gladdened her to hear him talk
      animatedly to Janet of the wonders of the forest and the romance of war.
      The hall, the staircase, and the walls of his smoking room were lined with
      curiosities of travel: spears and skin-covered shields, swords, wooden
      maces&mdash;a whole armoury of savage weapons. There were feathered
      headdresses, great rings roughly wrought of virgin gold, strange garments,
      some stained with blood. On the landing above the hall stairs hung an evil
      wooden yoke with pendent chains which he had lifted from the necks of two
      dead slaves, left by the caravan to die and rot by the way; and, flanking
      it, two great lions' heads glared defiantly. To each relic a history was
      attached, now commonplace, now ghastly. Clytie knew them all, but she
      accompanied her sisters as Thornton took them round, a perfect cicerone,
      and she was pleased to see his face light up and his eyes glow with the
      reminiscence of dangers and brave deeds. It brought her a glad memory of
      the past and a little hope for the future. She was grateful, too, to
      Thornton for thus effectually hiding from her sisters any signs of their
      recent differences and divergencies. She could receive their
      congratulations with a sense of grim humour. Anything approaching pity,
      with whatever delicate sympathy it might be conveyed, would have made her
      wince with pain. Even Mrs. Farquharson, who had sharp eyes and many kindly
      affinities with her, shared Mrs. Blather's unquestioning belief in the
      happiness of her lot. Before others Thornton was still the gallant lover
      and courteous husband, and Clytie was not unthankful. When questioned as
      to Thornton's plans for the autumn she answered vaguely. The session had
      worn him out. He was going up to Scotland for the grouse shooting. She
      herself was going to take care of the house until his return. She
      preferred staying in London in August to going anywhere without him. And
      Mrs. Blather, quite satisfied, paid her a little compliment on her
      wifeliness, and suggested various household improvements to occupy her
      time during her grass-widowhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mrs. Blather and Janet went back to Durdleham, to raise a flutter of
      excitement at the Durdleham tea tables over their accounts of Clytie's
      moral and material prosperity and her husband's manifold perfections. But
      the old man, Mr. Davenant, shook his head and sighed. Slow to receive
      fresh impressions, he could not conceive Clytie other than wilful and
      paradoxical. And he was suspicious of the brilliant soldier of fortune. He
      would much have preferred his daughter to have married a steady-going
      country gentleman or professional man. Still no fault could be found with
      Hammerdyke, who had treated him with every courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Thornton's departure for Scotland a kind of reconciliation was
      patched up between them. The first overtures had come from Clytie. After
      all, he was her husband. They were bound together, for better or worse,
      till death parted them. It was only common sense to struggle that it
      should be for better. She humbled herself, then, a little, confessed that
      she had been unreasonable in some things. He happened to be in a softer
      mood, and encouraged her to tell him she was sorry if she had been cold
      and selfish. Unconsciously she made him feel quite magnanimous. He kissed
      her gaily, bade her think no more about it, and even condescended to say
      with regard to the main point at issue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps you are about right in not caring to go to Durdleham. Your
      sisters are not rapid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A remark which, although it jarred somewhat on Clytie's strung nerves, she
      nevertheless accepted as a token of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the second time in her life that she had deliberately humbled
      herself before a man. She thought of it with a queer little pang. When she
      had put down her young pride so as to retain Kent's friendship and esteem,
      on the day that Jack had destroyed Winifred's picture, it had been all
      gladness and triumph. She remembered how happily she had gone to sleep
      that night, in pleasant subconsciousness of certain feminine workings. It
      had been a joy to surrender then. But now? She shrugged her shoulders,
      tried to dismiss it from her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of August she found herself alone in the great house,
      enjoying the leisure and solitude, the independence, the freedom from
      friction. She devoted most of her time to her painting, which had been
      sadly neglected since her marriage. Her studio was a pleasant room, with a
      good light. It had not the severe, businesslike air of the one in the
      King's Road; it was warmer, heavier with velvet hangings, richer in quaint
      furniture. Instead of the whitewashed walls scrawled over with grotesque
      caricatures, it had a delicately toned Morris paper. The floor was
      polished, strewn with thick rugs; a great white bearskin lay before the
      hearth. The piles of canvases stretched upon rough wooden backs that used
      to lie stacked up in odd corners Thornton had had framed for her, as a
      surprise to greet her on her home-coming, and now the best of them were
      hung round the room. Some of her cherished possessions found a place&mdash;the
      etching by Rupert Kent, two or three of Winifred's delicate studies, and
      an exquisite Jacquemart that Kent had given her long ago. But otherwise
      all was new, luxurious, separating her from the old associations of her
      art life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst searching for a subject she took out her studies for the Faustina
      picture. But she put them aside with a shudder. She was painting merely
      for amusement, to gratify the artistic impulse that urged her to create.
      But the hope, by which she had been gradually rising towards the goal of
      her ambition, the hope of fame and full accomplishment, was gone,
      apparently beyond recall; and she mused upon it sadly. This sense of
      finality is characteristic of youth&mdash;its one governing pessimism. Yet
      she was cheerful enough, glad to feel the brush between her fingers again,
      and to smell the familiar odour of turpentine, and to see her fancies take
      visible form under her touch. The artist within her asserted itself,
      though vaguely, as from some depth where it lay buried. It was undergoing
      a subtle change, and its weak, inchoate manifestations were those of a
      period of transition. But Clytie knew it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Farquharsons returned to town towards the end of the month, and
      Winifred also, after her annual seaside holiday with the children. And
      many of Clytie's other friends remained in London, and welcomed her back
      among them. It was like a return to her old life. Only Kent was absent
      from her circle. She missed him, sighing a little for the impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton wrote from Scotland with affectionate brevity. He did not know
      that he could have missed her so much. He had bagged so many brace that
      morning. He longed to see her. He thought he might as well stay on with
      Carteret so long as there was any sport forward. His letters, dashed off
      with a broad quill pen in a great, bold hand, covered four sides of
      notepaper, and came once a week. Clytie had no reason to complain of lack
      of attention on the part of her husband. Consequently she looked forward
      to less troubled days when they should lead their common life together
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      An occasional visitor that she had during these weeks was the boy Jack. He
      had been for a term at the industrial school to which Treherne and Kent
      had procured him admittance, and now passed as a reformed character
      amongst his enthusiasts. The teachers at the school, with vivid memories
      of stormy scenes, might have demurred at this opinion; but they were miles
      away holiday-making, and for the time blissfully oblivious of Jack. Four
      months over a spelling-book and a carpenter's bench, even though the
      latter may be situated amid pleasant fields, are not long enough to purify
      the blood from the wildness of London streets; and a lifetime so spent
      cannot wash out hereditary taint; but they can teach the use of soap and
      water and a suitable adjustment of garments. And Jack was clean, and his
      wild elf locks were cropped into compulsory smugness, and his clothes
      conformed to a strictly conventional order. This external revolution was
      so startling that an accompanying moral reform seemed unquestionable.
      Even his mother's dull pessimism was affected by it. When she returned
      from her work she bribed him with bread and treacle to sit in a chair
      where she could admire him, instead of sending him out of her way into the
      streets as she had been wont to do. But Jack ate the bread and treacle and
      then sauntered into the street of his own accord. He did not admire his
      mother, and only heeded her blandishments when they assumed an objective
      form. He admired one person, and that was Winifred. With her the young
      animal was tame, almost docile. It was merely owing to lack of special
      instinct that he did not lick her hand. He was often in the studio, where
      he had been constituted general factotum during his holidays. He swept the
      floor, cleaned the windows, set the brushes and paints in order before
      Winifred arrived, ran messages for her, and whenever she permitted would
      sprawl on the ground by her side, following her movements with his great
      brown eyes. To prevent him from wasting his time and energies in this
      passive adoration, Winifred often invented commissions for him which he
      executed with proud despatch, disregarding all allurements to eat the
      lotus of the gutter and holding his person sacred as Winifred's messenger.
      It was in consequence of this that he found his way to Clytie's house,
      acting as postman for his patroness. At first he was shy. He had not lost
      the feeling of awe with which Clytie inspired him, nor had he forgotten
      the dread picture of her anger on that day when she had summarily
      dismissed him from her service. It was only his devotion to Winifred that
      had induced him to put, as it seemed to him, his head in the lion's mouth.
      But when he found that the lion was kind and roared as gently as his own
      dove, and further, gave him various unimaginable dainties to eat and odd
      shillings to spend in surreptitious tobacco, the house in the Cromwell
      Road became invested with pleasant associations.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after Clytie had had two or three visits from him that the idea
      occurred to her to paint the portrait of the reformed Jack. The sittings
      continued long after the necessity for them had ceased. Jack came of his
      own accord. At last one day he astonished her by refusing the shilling
      that she held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't come for that,&rdquo; he said bluntly. &ldquo;I come to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie and the urchin in industrial school corduroys looked steadily for
      some seconds at one another, and both in their respective ways were
      conscious of having added to their sum of knowledge. Then they became real
      friends. Clytie looked upon him with a new interest, taking herself
      severely to task for having summed him up in the past with such scornful
      superficiality. She atoned for it now by seeking to interest herself in
      his life, to give herself a little place in it, whereby it should receive
      some individual colour. This was all the easier now, as Winifred had
      smoothed down many of Jack's social asperities. Albeit not refined of
      speech, he no longer used profane language in the studio, nor did he
      entertain her with sanguinary details of cat murder. When the time came
      for him to return to school Clytie felt quite sorry.

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hornton returned
      in due time. The autumn session began. The weeks and months passed. Their
      relations remained the same as when they had parted in the summer. Towards
      Clytie he manifested a kindly indifference, so long as she obeyed his
      wishes. When she went counter to them he flared up, showed his teeth, and
      swore; on which occasions Clytie would draw herself up, and, with her chin
      in the air, leave the room and retire into her studio. Then, after two or
      three days of evil sullenness, the fancy would take him to kiss her, and
      lightly swear that she was the loveliest woman in the world. But Clytie
      had lost all responsive feeling. She met him not wholly unaffectionately,
      but calmly, presenting an obedient, passionless cheek. Thereupon he would
      either storm again or laugh, reminding her of a time when her lips sought
      his, asking her why she had frozen, where was the Clytie of their bridal
      month. And if he pleaded gently, womanlike, she would relent a little,
      yield to him, striving to blot out the objects that met her sight as she
      looked back towards the past. Then there would recur the season of
      indifference, which Clytie had grown to welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daily life went on, she scarce knew how. Visiting, entertaining,
      painting, filled her days. And she dreamed wistful little dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there came to Clytie a great calm, a new, strange happiness, in
      the midst of the life she had thought to be broken. She would sit by
      herself and think, with a smile playing round the corners of her lips, and
      a light in her eyes. Again the order of things seemed changed. Again a
      newer life, with newer hopes and responsibilities, lay before her. For the
      time her art, her needs, were forgotten. Trifling, dainty occupations
      absorbed her as she sat in the solitude of the studio on the chilly autumn
      days, her feet luxuriously buried in the bearskin before the great fire.
      Sometimes Mrs. Farquharson would come and help her, with a yearning hunger
      in her eyes that Clytie knew the meaning of; for Caroline was a childless
      woman. And then Clytie would kiss her silently and Caroline would shake
      her head and laugh, and talk in her bright way of the wonder that would
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only at times did a wave of bitterness pass over her. If all that had
      happened in her married life since the train had carried her out of
      Bordighera station had been different! If only she could see her husband
      as she saw him that day, by the ruined tower, when she passed her hand
      over his hair and thought him all that could suffice a woman's needs!
      Sometimes she looked at him now, furtively, when his face was in repose.
      He seemed the same, handsome, brave, ideally perfect in manhood. Why had
      not the glamour lasted? Why should the &ldquo;dream be better than the drink&rdquo;?
      And then she would turn away and the thought would rise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I not continue blind? Would to God this knowledge of him had
      never come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grew a little kinder to her, however. It was a rough, patronising
      tenderness, it is true, but yet Clytie felt grateful. A little act of
      forethought and consideration softened her towards him much more than it
      warranted. Perhaps in spite of all he might have won her to him again, and
      brought her lips to his in a kiss of rare meaning&mdash;for at certain
      times there are wondrous tendernesses and wondrous powers of forgiveness
      in woman. But Thornton lost the golden chance, being busy with his
      muck-rake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came home one afternoon, in an evil humour. Clytie, prepared to welcome
      him, looked up kindly from her lounge-chair as he came into the studio,
      but as she saw the blackness of his face, her heart sank. A footstool came
      in his way, and he sent it, with a kick, sliding along the polished floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you litter up the place with these infernal traps, Clytie?&rdquo; he
      asked crossly as he came up to the fire to warm his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie, like a wise woman, held her peace. Silence is a very good friend
      sometimes. But as he remained there moodily, without saying a word, and
      the silence was growing uncomfortable, she asked him what was amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything's amiss!&rdquo; he replied roughly&mdash;&ldquo;all through your silly
      folly. Read that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew a letter from his pocket book and threw it into her lap. It ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Hernshawe:
    </p>
    <p>
      As I think Simmons would be a more satisfactory man for Burchester than
      Hammerdyke, I have suggested the former to the local Conservative
      association. As they seem rather at a loss for a suitable candidate, I
      think they will accept my nominee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours truly,
    </p>
    <p>
      E. Godderich.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, Thornton,&rdquo; said Clytie, laying the letter down on the
      afternoon tea table by her side. &ldquo;But you hardly expected to have a chance
      so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I am going to slave away at this hack's work for two or
      three years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but this is only the second or third vacancy that has occurred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that matter? Godderich promised to run me as soon as he saw an
      opening. Hernshawe was amazed at this letter this morning. Don't talk of
      what you know nothing about. It's simply infernal spite on Godderich's
      part! Who is Simmons? A damned cheesemonger with a jubilee knighthood, and
      as much brains as a double Glo'ster! Godderich has the reputation for this
      sort of thing. That was why I wanted to keep in with him. If you had taken
      a ha'porth of interest in the matter, it would not have happened. You have
      treated the man in your confounded icy
      don't-address-me-or-I'll-petrify-you kind of way, and you have put his
      back up against us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always treated him courteously,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by Jove, I know what that means!&rdquo; sneered Thornton. &ldquo;And now you can
      have the satisfaction of seeing how your courtesy has played the fool with
      my plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't understand you, Thornton,&rdquo; she replied wearily. &ldquo;I should have
      thought you of all people would have preferred to win your own battles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I shall in future. I shall take jolly good care not to ask you to help
      me any more! After all your fine professions of identifying yourself with
      my life and that sort of rot I really thought you would be willing to help
      me&mdash;in about the only way a woman can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a silly, ignoble flirtation? Would you really hope to win success by
      your wife's dishonour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, rot!&rdquo; cried Thornton savagely. &ldquo;Who the devil talked about
      dishonour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we don't see things in the same light,&rdquo; said Clytie quietly.
      &ldquo;And I am very glad you have lost Godderich's influence, if that is what
      it depended upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and faced her, in one of his blind rages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you say at once you don't care a little damn about me? It would
      be nearer the truth. What the deuce did I marry you for, when there are
      thousands of better women in the world who are to be had for the asking?
      About the only thing I have ever asked you to do for me was to employ a
      little womanly tact, and then you get up on the high horse, damme! and
      talk about dishonour! One would have thought you had been bred in a
      nunnery instead of the disreputable gutter in the King's Road I found you
      in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop!&rdquo; said Clytie, rising. &ldquo;If I were well, perhaps I might be angry
      and amuse you with a row. But I am not equal to it at present, believe me.
      I'll see you at dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked towards the door, but Thornton intercepted her with three or
      four quick strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hanged if you do!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have too much respect for my
      digestion. I'm not going to stay in the house with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he strode out of the studio, slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said Clytie to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the film of reconciliation that new circumstances had begun to
      spread was rudely torn asunder, and the breach between them grew greater
      than before. For several days Clytie suffered. Then she resigned herself
      to the inevitable, and in her thoughts drifted away from her husband. For
      they were sweet thoughts, full of unspeakable consolation. And the weeks
      wore on, and the evenings grew shorter and shorter, and the little pile of
      dainty needlework grew higher in the press. Thornton rarely disturbed her;
      the time that he could spare from his official duties he passed as a man
      about town idles the hours away. A man with the least domestic tastes in
      the world, he found no especial pleasures in his house. His wife did not
      amuse him; the cooking at his club was more to his taste than that which
      awaited him at home. There was no earthly reason why he should use the
      house for any other purpose than sleeping, breakfasting, and the
      occasional entertainment, which was now discontinued for a season. He
      lived his own life, more or less satisfactory to himself, and left Clytie
      to her own devices. Wherefore she not unfrequently thanked the Almighty.
      She lived practically alone. Winifred came to see her from time to time.
      Mrs. Farquharson was often with her. The shrewd eyes of Caroline saw that
      there was something wrong in the marriage of which she had augured such
      fair fruits. But as Clytie proudly kept all her troubles to herself,
      Caroline could do no more than surround Clytie with her mute sympathy.
      This gradual discovery was a shock to her faith in human nature. One of
      the two had failed; which one was it? Her instinct told her that it was
      not Clytie; her husband unequivocally affirmed that it was Hammerdyke.
      When her instinct and her husband differed she sometimes trusted to one
      and sometimes to the other, by way of giving a certain variety to life.
      When they coincided she had no option but to believe. So, although giving
      up her hero cost her a great pang, her heart went out more than ever to
      her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a period of strange new happiness for Clytie. It showed itself
      outwardly in her art. No one but herself has ever seen the pictures that
      she painted during this time&mdash;not even Caroline. They were all
      unfinished, sketched in the hurried, semi-impressionist manner with which
      from her early girlhood she had been wont to give objectivity to her
      cravings and imaginings; but they were dainty, laughing, tender things, a
      world of waxen touches and sweet hopes. It would be hard to say how many
      small panels she covered with the promises of this new life. Sometimes,
      when she was quite alone, she would lock the door and take them out and
      arrange them along the wall on the ledge above the dado, and gladden her
      heart with them. After which she would collect them hastily and lock them
      up, with a smile at her own foolishness. She meditated now and then,
      before the fire, with closed eyes, turning over the leaves of her Book of
      New Formulas, which had grown somewhat tear-stained and dusty; but she
      found in it nothing relating to present things, and she laughed quietly at
      the omission, resolving to rectify it by and by. It was strange that she
      had not included this in her scheme of life. And yet, after all, was it so
      strange? She could not quite decide. But the future she never questioned.
      The evolution of her own individuality seemed in no wise to concern her.
      She had projected herself into another life. And she looked at the world,
      and again she saw it fair; and peace rested on her eyelids as she slept.
      And the weeks went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening in the middle of December Thornton and herself were alone
      together. They had finished dinner and he was smoking a cigar with his
      coffee in the dining-room. Relations between them were beginning to grow
      kindlier again. That is to say, he curbed his temper, inquired after her
      health, and occasionally spent an evening at home. They had not spoken
      much during the meal. Now that they had so few interests in common, their
      conversation was generally desultory. The one great and precious bond that
      was to be between them was rarely mentioned. It was too deeply rooted in
      the holiest place of Clytie's soul for her to discuss it in the
      commonplace interviews she had with her husband, and his interest in the
      matter did not go much beyond a rather irritating sense of responsibility.
      Some feeling of the sort prompted him on this evening to allude to the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard from the Claverings this morning,&rdquo; he said, knocking off his
      cigar ash into the fender. &ldquo;They want us to go and spend Christmas with
      them in their new place in Hampshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said Clytie politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen Mrs. Clavering several times during the summer in town, and
      further acquaintance had only increased the antipathy she had conceived in
      Paris. Thornton, however, had been pretty intimate with them during the
      latter part of the season, and he had met Major Clavering again in
      Scotland. Hence the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Thornton, &ldquo;what shall I do? Of course your going is out of
      the question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; replied Clytie, glad that that point was settled without any
      discussion. &ldquo;Why do you ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To know what your wishes are as regards myself. Clavering has got some
      good shooting, I believe, and his wife always keeps a decent house. I
      don't see what good I should be here; but still, if you would like me to
      stay on and see you through, I don't mind a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meant to be magnanimous. Perhaps he expected his wife to be duly
      grateful; as it was she only replied somewhat wearily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must do whatever you think best, Thornton. I should not like to keep
      you here on my account, while you might be having a good time with your
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it's all the same to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's just as you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie shook her head despondently. If there could have been any pleasure
      to either of them in his staying, these questions would have been
      impossible. It was love and not politeness that should have kept him by
      her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very kind to think of it, Thornton,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I thank you
      for asking me; but you couldn't do much if you stayed, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should be somewhat in the way,&rdquo; he said good-temperedly. &ldquo;That
      sort of thing is not much in my line. However, I did not like to accept
      without asking you. Are you sure you don't mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, quite sure!&rdquo; said Clytie suavely.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the point was amicably settled, and Thornton went down to Hampshire to
      shoot Clavering's pheasants and to be led cynically captive by Clavering's
      wife. To avoid giving the latter a gratuitous loophole for sarcastic
      attack, he forbore to hint at the cause that prevented Clytie from
      accompanying him. He said vaguely that she was with her people. Mrs.
      Clavering did not press the point in any way, as she reciprocated Clytie's
      dislike, and was perfectly indifferent as to what became of her. In fact
      she was greatly relieved when Thornton announced that he was coming alone.
      Him she could manage as she liked&mdash;or thought she could, which comes
      to the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house which the Claverings had taken for the winter was one that
      appealed to the quieter tastes of a man like Thornton. There was good
      hunting in the neighbourhood, and the stables were well filled with
      hunters, some of which Major Clavering had hired for the season. Over the
      estate attached to the house was excellent partridge shooting, and the
      covers were stocked with pheasants. The house itself was straggling&mdash;as
      a country house should be&mdash;roomy, and capable of accommodating
      comfortably the large party that was assembled for Christmas. It contained
      two billiard tables, a concert room staged for private theatricals, and a
      magnificent club-furnished smoking-room with a specially made baccarat
      table. Among the party the masculine element greatly preponderated, but
      the few women who were there had been carefully selected by the hostess to
      maintain a nice equilibrium. The major invited the men, and his wife,
      running over the list, had settled upon the women. She was doubly grateful
      that Clytie had thought fit to decline.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of his arrival Thornton came down early after dressing and
      found Mrs. Clavering alone in the drawing-room, reclining luxuriously
      before the blaze under the great marble chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clavering must have come into a pot of money in order to run this,&rdquo; he
      said, parting his coat tails. &ldquo;I have just been round the place. I had no
      idea it was such an extensive development.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's better than soldiering. Tom's looking out for a place of his
      own something after the style of this. The Dynevors wanted to go to
      Australia, and so they have let it to us cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, not very interested, and twirled his moustache in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not making a very good start by way of being amusing,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Clavering. &ldquo;How is your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well. But I don't see how that topic could amuse you. Matrimony
      isn't very funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to get out of the toils, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Passably. It leaves me free in the society of the only woman I have
      reasonably cared for,&rdquo; he said, without changing his attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come down to play at that sort of thing again?&rdquo; she asked,
      arching her eyebrows, with a little supercilious curl on her thin lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what you wanted me here for, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came to shoot little birds on the invitation of my adoring husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the motives were mixed. You wouldn't believe me if I told you I
      had come to see you. That was my main inducement. I suppose I ought to
      have begun better and told you of my longing and despair. Let me make my
      declaration now, Clara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! my friend. What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; she said cynically.
      &ldquo;You don't care a straw for me&mdash;you told me yourself I had gone off
      lamentably. And I don't rate you a halfpenny above your worth. You are a
      fine-looking man with impulses and animal passions instead of brains and
      heart; and if you were to die to-morrow, my delicate appreciation of my
      dinner would not be impaired. So why in the name of common sense have we
      revived this miserable farce?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a kind of absinthe. We like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could pump up any enthusiasm about you,&rdquo; she went on, not heeding
      his epigram, &ldquo;I could understand it. But you are bad all through. You
      would not even be moderately faithful to me&mdash;as you are not to your
      wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; asked Thornton quickly, showing his teeth.
      But Mrs. Clavering laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you take me for a fool, or a woman of the world, my friend? I have
      eyes and I have ears. I'll go into particulars if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would scarcely be interesting,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for some moments and then burst out into his resonant
      laugh, expecting boyish indulgence for his peccadilloes. His whole-hearted
      animal laughter was irresistible. The woman joined in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know which is the worse of us two,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps I. I
      forgive you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The piquant cynicism of this revived liaison attracted Thornton, was an
      enjoyable complement to the essentially masculine side of that
      country-house life. He was a keen, brilliant sportsman, a famous shot, a
      perfect though reckless rider, standing out in all physical qualities far
      above the other men of his type who were his fellow-guests. By them he was
      flattered, in an honest British way, his acts were applauded, and his
      opinions received with respect. In the slaying of creatures, brute or
      human, he was an indubitable authority. And although he was accustomed to
      a certain shade of deference from his associates, it never failed to
      gratify his somewhat barbarous nature. Much of him had remained
      undeveloped. Small things pleased and captivated him. To be the central
      figure in this tiny world of sport was unalloyed pleasure to the man of
      fierce passions and heroic courage. And the bitter philandering in his
      relations with Mrs. Clavering amused, stimulated, irritated, and
      fascinated him. In his own way, therefore, he was enjoying himself
      exceedingly. Beyond writing Clytie a hurried note on the second day after
      his arrival, he scarcely recalled to himself her existence. When he did it
      was with petulant annoyance. He wished to God he had not been such a fool
      as to marry. And now what the deuce was the point of having children? But
      that was his wife's concern after all, for which he cordially thanked the
      wise contriver of the human mechanism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas came, was celebrated with much festivity. On Boxing Day there
      was a big partridge drive over a distant corner of the estate. It had been
      carefully saved for this one day's sport and the birds were accordingly
      plentiful. The best portion of it&mdash;a field sloping from a ridge and
      skirting a pine wood and then merging into a wide gorse-covered pasture
      tract&mdash;was reserved till after lunch. But the sport was good in the
      outlying approaches to this, and it was not without some irritation that
      Thornton tore open a telegram which a breathless messenger brought up. It
      announced the birth of a son. Thornton went on with the line across the
      wet, ploughed fields, but until they halted for lunch luck did not come
      his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clavering and the other ladies had walked over with the
      luncheon-baskets. The day was warm and relaxing. They lingered over the
      meal longer than they had intended. When a keeper came up and suggested
      that if they wanted to shoot the slope before dusk they had better be
      starting, the men sprang up in a hurry and betook themselves thither.
      Thornton was the extreme man, on the right, near the pine wood, which was
      being beaten. His ill-success in the morning had piqued his vanity. He was
      not accustomed to be second or third in matters of prowess. After he had
      brought down his first brace his whole frame was kindled with the desire
      to slay. Even partridges he could not kill calmly. Covey after covey was
      driven out of the wood, and as he had the first chance, his bag increased
      speedily. They had thus proceeded halfway down the long, straggling slope.
      The keeper by Thornton's side had just handed him his gun, and was
      watching the wood with intent, outstretched hand. A covey was being
      driven. At that moment another messenger, a boy, ran down the slope and
      put a telegram into Thornton's hand. With an impatient oath he stuffed it
      into the pocket of his shooting-coat, just in time to be able to fire his
      two barrels into the whirring flight of birds. The next man to him fired
      simultaneously. Two birds fell. The warm dispute that arose caused
      Thornton to forget the existence of the telegram in his pocket. And the
      continuance of the drive kept his mind entirely from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the party arrived home, and were standing for a moment in the
      hall, Mrs. Clavering came up to him and asked whether he had received his
      second telegram safely. Then he remembered. He drew it out, read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn!&rdquo; he muttered under his breath, and crumpling the flimsy sheet into
      a ball, threw it with a gesture of impatience into the fireplace. Then he
      turned and talked with Mrs. Clavering until he went upstairs to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      As chance willed, the crumpled telegram had not fallen into the blazing
      wood fire, but had struck upon a log and dropped on its unkindled side.
      And chance willed that Mrs. Clavering should have noticed this. Women of
      her type are cynically unscrupulous. As soon as the hall was clear of men
      she picked up the telegram and read it. Her face, which when she was by
      herself was somewhat faded, grew a little grayer. She put the telegram in
      her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chance willed also that Thornton and Mrs. Clavering should find themselves
      alone for a long spell after dinner in the little withdrawing-room, where
      smoking was permitted. Most of the men were tired. One or two of the women
      had gone up to their rooms. The rest were playing billiards. Thornton was
      in gay spirits, talking recklessly, giving her openings for sarcasms, and
      then closing in upon her with a brutality. It was an amusing game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she asked him irrelevantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going back to London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a wise woman,&rdquo; he replied, leaning back in his chair. &ldquo;But what do
      you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked you a question&mdash;a simple one. Are you going to London
      to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; why should I?&mdash;unless you are getting sentimental over me, and
      would prefer the illusion of my absence to the disenchantment of my bodily
      presence. If you mean it as a hint, of course I'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean it as a hint,&rdquo; she said with a hard kind of drawl. &ldquo;I didn't
      know you were quite such an unreasoning brute. Hadn't it occurred to you
      that it was only common decency to go off and help bury your newborn
      child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and gathering up her skirts, left him before he had time to
      recover.

      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hus it had
      happened with Clytie during Thornton's absence. There came a morning at
      the end of the Old Year when the snow and sleet dashing against the window
      could be dimly heard in the heavily curtained room, and Clytie feebly
      whispered: &ldquo;Give me the child.&rdquo; Gently they told her that the life had
      merely fluttered on the threshold and passed back into the silence whence
      it came. And she sank back on her pillows, struck to the heart with a
      dumb, hopeless heartsickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recovery was slow. Clytie lay for many days quite listless, the tears
      rolling down her cheeks, physical weakness aiding to make her feel a great
      self-pity. The long waiting, the fear, the pain, all had been counted as
      nothing if at the close there could have lain in her arms a little child&mdash;one
      whose touch would draw all pain from her heart, make her forget every
      sorrow. And the passionate child hunger, begotten of the pangs of
      maternity, woke within her and cried for satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole weight of the world's misery crushed down upon her. She awoke to
      a gray world. Its glory had departed. There was nothing left to live for,
      and a great despair came over her. What was the use of dragging out this
      broken, colourless existence until the time,&mdash;hopelessly remote it
      seemed to her, now that the blood ran again strongly through her veins,&mdash;should
      come for her to die? She passed through the phase common to all strong
      natures in supreme moments of weariness, when death seemed the only
      solution. One little draught out of a phial, an agonised convulsion,
      perhaps, and then eternal nothingness. She did not fear the annihilation
      which her materialism had taught her was the end of things. She had no
      eschatological sentimentality. But the full-pulsed animal's instinctive
      clutching after life held her back; the fit passed off, and she decided to
      live through another act of the dreary tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All feelings of tenderness, trust, common confidence in her husband, were
      swept away forever. The faintest breath of the old attraction caused her
      to shiver with repulsion. Henceforward they were mere acquaintances, who
      subsisted from a common fund, lived under the same roof, and performed
      certain conventional actions in common, for the sake of their own
      relations with a society that demands a certain outward show of harmony
      between husband and wife. Thornton had come to town from Hampshire in the
      vilest of tempers. For a day or two he positively hated Clytie. Then the
      seriousness of her illness had awakened in him a superficial sympathy. But
      as soon as she was out of danger he regarded her with cold dislike. She
      had abruptly terminated his pleasant holiday. She had gravely endangered
      his liaison with the only woman by whom he had been otherwise than purely
      sensually attracted, wherein lay an odd fascination, and in thus
      compelling him to her side she had sharply reminded him that a married
      man, if he wishes to keep in with the world, must not parade himself too
      conspicuously as his own master. And Thornton had his own reasons for not
      wishing to openly outrage society.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was able to travel Clytie went to Durdleham, for the first
      time since her marriage. The quiet, easy life soothed her for a while. She
      was in that condition of hopelessness when inaction seems the highest
      good. Mrs. Blather attributed her dejection to the objective cause, and
      sympathised with her as one woman can with another, and strove to cheer
      her; but still she privately thought this long brooding somewhat morbid.
      Clytie always went to extremes. But although she naturally was unconscious
      of the subtleties of dreariness in the causation of her sister's state,
      she was none the less helpful with her sympathy&mdash;and sympathy very
      often is all the stronger from the narrowness of the channel in which it
      flows.
    </p>
    <p>
      February and March passed in the quiet, monotonous Durdleham way. But as
      the spring grew into her blood Clytie felt the tingling of life once
      again, and the period of inactivity was over. She was not of the
      temperament to sit long with folded hands and lament over the futility of
      things. The old restlessness of her girlhood, though strangely modified,
      again urged her towards a fuller, more vivid existence. Again she looked
      out upon the world and its mysteries with a knowledge begotten of sorrow,
      and again vague longings took possession of her. She faced the new
      condition of things bravely, resolved to struggle towards a newer, better
      content. If the short dream had come true, she would have found happiness
      in the guidance of another life; but the high gods had ordained otherwise.
      As before her marriage, her only problem was the working out of her own
      individuality; for henceforward Thornton would be her husband only in
      name. In what direction should she carry herself so as to prevent the
      fulfilling of her needs from developing into ignoble egoism? As a girl she
      had studied life eagerly, had painted from artistic impulses, from desire
      for fame, and from material necessity. Her enthusiasms, the intimacy of
      her odd social life with Kent and Winifred, had kept her pure and fresh.
      Now all was changed. She was alone. She had learned many things: the touch
      of the fire of passion, the taste of the waters of bitterness. Definite
      enthusiasms seemed to be wanting; only the artistic impulse urging
      creation remained to her&mdash;together with mechanical skill. How was she
      to occupy her life to a fair and noble purpose? She tried to solve the
      problem calmly, was wise enough to smile when she discovered that she
      failed. One cannot range a row of potential enthusiasms in front of one,
      like oranges, and select in cold blood. So Clytie determined to have faith
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      &ldquo;... large in time,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And that which shapes it to some end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had arrived at this decision she threw off her moodiness
      and became bright again, to the great joy of Mrs. Blather, who was sighing
      for her to join in such Easter dissipations as Durdleham society offered.
      In obedience to her sister, therefore, Clytie burst upon Durdleham like a
      revelation. During her girlhood Durdleham had regarded her as odd, refused
      to accept her as conducive to social amenities. Now it worshipped her with
      dazzled eyes&mdash;the whirligig of time thus bringing in its revenges.
      The irony of the position amused her, but at the same time it brought out
      in her much that was good and whole-hearted. She saw, perhaps for the
      first time, that much of the decorous dulness that had once chafed her to
      frenzy proceeded from an almost childlike ignorance of the possibilities
      of enjoyment. For a wild moment the idea entered her head to convert
      Durdleham to epicureanism. Janet, to whom she confided this visionary
      scheme, stared at her open-mouthed, and Clytie burst out into genuine
      mirth. Durdleham was willing to be amused, eager to be brightened by a
      brilliant woman; but it would not be convinced. It held by its principles,
      would not yield an iota in a single formula. Still it could be brought to
      treat a paradox as a joke instead of brooding over it with the stolidity
      of a hen sitting on a china nest-egg. And that much Clytie did accomplish
      during the short season of her social triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of April she was requested by Thornton to return to London.
      He had thrown up the private-secretaryship, as his purpose in accepting it
      had been already served. By dint of self-assertion he had identified
      himself with the non-parliamentary chiefs of the Tory party, and during
      the early spring had rendered efficient electioneering services. His
      chance of a candidature was therefore only a question of time. But as he
      wished to neglect no means of keeping himself in evidence, he still felt
      bound to call upon his wife to aid him socially&mdash;that is to say, to
      preside at his table and receive his guests. This Clytie was not
      disinclined to do, especially as his summons was couched in pleasant and
      courteous terms. So she bade farewell to Durdleham and returned to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her train arrived at Euston she was surprised at seeing Thornton on
      the platform. He wore a gray frock-coat with a dark rose in the
      buttonhole, and lavender kid gloves. He came forward and greeted her,
      raising his hat before he shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a tiring journey? You are looking very well. As I was paying
      a call near Primrose Hill,&mdash;ghastly place to live in, isn't it?&mdash;I
      thought I might as well pick you up here with the brougham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very kind of you, Thornton,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked of indifferent subjects during the long drive to South
      Kensington: the theatres, odds and ends of gossip. When they got home he
      accompanied her into the drawing-room and drank a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a deuced lovely woman, you know, Clytie,&rdquo; he said, his great bulk
      sprawling over a small drawing-room chair, his hands in his pockets. &ldquo;I
      have half a mind to fall in love with you again. If you had not turned
      into absolute ice, perhaps I should. You've got that same devilish
      witchery in your skin that made me go wild over you a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please don't talk of that, Thornton. It is the past,&rdquo; she said, with
      a tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my soul!&rdquo; he said, gathering himself together. &ldquo;I don't see
      why it might not be the present. I was going to unfold to you a little
      scheme by which we might live politely together, but, by Jove! now I look
      at you and reflect that you are my wife after all&mdash;you're so
      gloriously beautiful, Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, but she was on her feet before him, having sprung up with a
      beating heart. She looked at him with a fearful surmise in her glance, and
      as he made a stride towards her she recoiled in a terror she had not known
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no! For God's sake!&rdquo; she cried, catching at her breath,
      instinctively putting out her hands to keep him off. &ldquo;That is all over. We
      loved one another once. A horrible mockery of it is more than I can bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Clytie!&rdquo; he exclaimed, clenching his hands and showing his
      teeth, &ldquo;you're my wife, and, by the Lord! I'll kiss you if I choose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flash of his brown eyes that had once overpowered her will now made
      her shudder. She stiffened into a woman of iron, with bloodless cheeks.
      Standing up perfectly rigid, she closed her eyes, and hung her hands
      against her sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me, then, since you claim the right,&rdquo; she said in a choked voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two he stood looking at her. Then with a loud laugh he
      flung himself back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie with shame and horror in her heart rushed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not an encouraging home-coming. The incident, though not repeated,
      upset many of her plans for the reconstitution of her existence. It added
      a new dread. For she had counted upon the continuance of the entire
      indifference with which Thornton had grown to regard her. A sudden
      outburst like this had not occurred for many months. What guarantee had
      she that this was not the beginning of a series of spasmodic rekindlings
      of a fire she had thought dead? For some days anxiety lay heavy on her
      mind. But human nature is very elastic; if it were not so, God help us
      all! After a while she recovered and was able to talk calmly to Thornton,
      who began by treating her with an ironical politeness, and then relapsed
      into his usual cheerful indifference. Once while discussing their mutual
      relations she broached the subject of separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't consent,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As we can't be lovers, we may as well be
      friends. You would gain very little by it. Besides, people would talk, and
      for me that is an important consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hardly concerns me,&rdquo; she said, with a touch of cynicism that was new
      to her. &ldquo;Still, if you wish it very much, I will remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do wish it, Clytie,&rdquo; he said in a softened voice. &ldquo;You can go your way,
      I will go mine. But we must live together as far as the world sees us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie yielded with some misgivings, and set herself to work to discover
      interests in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The society life of London, in which she was free to play an important
      part, did not satisfy her. She saw too deep below the surface of things to
      be guilty of the silly cynicism that finds society hollow, its aims
      futile, and its morals corrupt. There is earnestness even among cultivated
      men and women. But society is formal, conventional, and in the external
      rules of life differs only in degree from Durdleham. True, it has a far
      wider intellectual scope. Contrary to Durdleham, it permits the possession
      of ideas, but it is just as punctilious as to their correct expression.
      The elaborate ceremonial of society weighed upon Clytie. She preferred a
      simpler, directer life. There were so many wrappings of convention to be
      pierced through before she could get to the heart of a thing or a person,
      and they wearied, irritated her. And now, as Thornton seemed to care very
      little whether she placed herself in evidence or not, beyond playing the
      part of hostess in his house, she consulted merely her own desires in her
      acceptance of invitations. But as the circle from which these mainly
      proceeded was that into which her husband's reputation, tastes, and
      political aspirations had led her, she did not find in it the interests
      which particularly affected her. It was beyond her power either to feel or
      to simulate an interest in Thornton's ambitions. Nor did she feel called
      upon now to profess the tenets of Thornton's political creed. She was a
      solitary, unconventional Radical in the midst of the most uncompromising
      Torydom, which is an unenviable position even for the least rabid
      politician. The political section, therefore, of her social circle she
      studiously avoided. The purely fashionable, frivolous element, that goes
      to Hurlingham and Ascot, and makes itself merry over material things, had
      attracted her the previous year with its graceful epicureanism. She had
      still been proud of her husband and his boyish zest in amusement, and she
      had caught from him the spirit of laughing Babylon. But now it was pain to
      be with him when he chatted and jested with pretty girls and idle young
      men. His light-hearted gaiety jarred upon her. She saw that men and women
      were affected by his charm, and she had half longings to tell them it was
      a lie. So she withdrew herself from their midst as much as possible. By
      this process of elimination Clytie's circle became conveniently limited.
      She was sick at heart, and she turned more and more to the friends of her
      girlhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Farquharson's Sunday evenings became pleasant spots in her barren
      week. She went there alone, as in the old days. Nothing was changed there:
      the same faces, the same bright, eager talk, the same welcome. Clytie
      became her old self, was astonished to find how many enthusiasms she still
      retained. She almost forgot that she was married, and had said farewell to
      theories of life and such like vanities. Only at times, when her own art
      came within the range of a friendly arrow, did she wince and remember with
      a pang that Clytie Davenant was dead. Redgrave, whom she occasionally met,
      forbore, with a portrait painter's intuitive delicacy, to question her
      upon the progress of her art under its new conditions. He divined that his
      prophecies had been correct, and he was sad; because he had had great
      hopes of Clytie. In a tentative way he spoke of it to Mrs. Farquharson,
      who confided to him her own surmises as to the dubious success of the
      marriage. Then Redgrave brightened, and declared that there was hope yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Caroline with a touch of indignation; whereat
      Redgrave smiled in his serene way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that hitherto she has tried to look at life through her art. Now
      she will be able to look at art through her life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then her art will be very feeble and miserable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie's life has never been feeble and miserable,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I feared
      it was going to be so&mdash;in a special sense, you know; I feared that
      she would be overpowered by the physical element her husband would bring
      into her atmosphere, and that she would develop into the fashionable
      married woman, and thus, at the same time, suffer in spirituality and lose
      her grip upon the subjects that form her artistic range.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see how an unhappy married life can help her,&rdquo; said Caroline. &ldquo;If
      such a deterioration is possible, it has taken place already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless it has,&rdquo; Redgrave replied earnestly. &ldquo;But it is not final. If
      she lives within herself again, she will recover spirituality and grip&mdash;both
      strengthened by experience and suffering. That is the most precious
      knowledge, Mrs. Farquharson, which we have bought with sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then mine must be very worthless,&rdquo; cried Caroline. &ldquo;And I'm very glad of
      it. I would rather be ignorant and happy than wise and sad. And I could
      wish the same for poor Clytie. I can understand the good and beautiful
      things of this world as well as most people, but I don't believe in art to
      all that extent. I may be a Philistine,&mdash;God forbid it, but perhaps I
      am,&mdash;and I like to see people happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon what you call happiness,&rdquo; said Redgrave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Caroline was not to be led into an argument. She had her views and
      expounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean common, all-round human happiness,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that makes you
      laugh to yourself when there's no particular reason for it. And I'd sooner
      Clytie have that and never touch a brush than paint the most
      world-convulsing pictures and be wretched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if she painted world-convulsing pictures, as you call them, she would
      be happy&mdash;much happier than under the other conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, she wouldn't!&rdquo; she replied, with a conclusive nod. &ldquo;You are quite
      wrong, my dear good friend. It is a secondary consideration to a woman
      whether she convulses the world or not. It might amuse and gratify her to
      do it <i>en passant</i>, but it is only <i>en passant</i>. Believe me. I
      don't give my sex away as a general rule, but I make you a present of
      that! So if you're glad,&rdquo; she added with triumphant feminine logic, &ldquo;that
      Clytie has made an unhappy marriage, I think it is simply detestable of
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Redgrave, routed, retired in confusion; but he took his own ideas with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Sunday evening, early in July, Mrs. Farquharson ran into the room
      where Clytie, just arrived, was taking off her wraps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been waiting by the window ever so long, watching for your
      carriage. You are quite late. I wanted to see you before you came into the
      drawing-room. Who do you think is here? Guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie saw at once by Caroline's face. A little thrill of gladness sent
      the colour to her cheeks and caused her eyes to sparkle as she paused with
      one glove half off and looked quickly at her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Caroline nodded, glad at seeing that Clytie was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to drop you a line, but how could I on Sunday in this postless
      town? George only condescended to tell me last night that he was coming.
      If we had as little sense as men, I wonder how on earth we should get on!
      He met him out a week ago and persuaded him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be quite like an old evening, dear,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;I shall be so
      glad to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange you should not have met,&rdquo; said Caroline; and then she added
      reflectively: &ldquo;Well, perhaps it isn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had her own theories on the subject. And to say a woman has her own
      theories is to say a good deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't see why he should have let us almost lose sight of him,&rdquo; she
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reason does he give?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the reason that makes one so helpless, you know. A man you like comes
      to you and says: 'I have sinned against you without any cause whatever. It
      was just my own badness, and nothing else, and now I am humble and
      repentant'&mdash;and what are you to do but forgive him? He's very
      penitent now and vows amendment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie completed her little toilet arrangements and went downstairs with
      Caroline. On their way Caroline asked her where Thornton was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's at Goodwood, staying with some people there. He went down yesterday
      for the races.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't it have brightened you up to have gone too?&rdquo; asked Caroline with
      deliberate tactlessness, darting a quick feminine side glance. But Clytie
      broke into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! good gracious, no! I didn't even know he was going till yesterday,
      when Roberts asked me about something he was to do during the master's
      absence. We are quite old married people now, Caroline, and we each go
      more or less our own way. It saves a lot of trouble. You see, he knew I
      wouldn't care for Goodwood and the set he's in with there&mdash;the
      Claverings and such like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think you are better off here,&rdquo; said Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I am,&rdquo; replied Clytie, taking her arm. And then they went into the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie's first impulse on entering was to look round for Kent. She met his
      eyes fixed upon her from the other side of the rather crowded room, and
      she gave him a little nod of greeting. He rose and joined the knot of
      people who were surrounding her. Both were self-conscious to the extent of
      knowing that, as they had once been a familiar couple in that company, it
      would be inexpedient to allow it to be noticed that their meeting was an
      event to them. They shook hands, with a friendly commonplace, and joined
      in the general conversation. Redgrave, French, the journalist, Mr.
      Singleton, Mrs. Tredegar, were there&mdash;most of the old faces, a few
      new ones. To see Kent's among them was a joy to Clytie. She had never
      understood why he had broken from her. Now and then the true solution
      passed through her mind, but she rejected it. It was incongruous with his
      action. Love begets wants, and it is the nature of man to clamour for
      them. This was her hasty conclusion. But she had avoided thinking very
      deeply upon the subject, instinctively deeming it wiser to refrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not changed, she thought; and wondered whether he would notice any
      change in her. She found herself listening again to him as he talked, in
      his downright, earnest way, quickly noting familiar turns of thought and
      expression, admiring the thoroughness of his unconventional enthusiasm.
      The old contented humility of spirit came back to her. How much more real
      than hers was his life! How much she had learned and could learn from him!
      And for a short, swift moment the laughter and talk sounded dull in her
      ears, and all the objects around, all the faces save one, melted away into
      the blue cigarette smoke, and that one face remained&mdash;sitting at a
      table opposite to her, the lamp between them&mdash;and the brows were
      intent on the sheet over which a quill pen was scratching assiduously; and
      the surroundings shaped themselves into her old rooms in the King's Road.
      Then, just as swiftly as it had come, the dream vanished, and Clytie
      sighed. The talk languished a little. Kent looked somewhat wistfully at
      her. She leaned forward and beckoned him with a smile and a little upward
      movement of her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down and give me some supper,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not eat anything
      before coming out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was foolish of you,&rdquo; he said involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they both laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are just the same as ever,&rdquo; she said. And they went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tradition in Harley Street that on Sunday evenings a cold supper
      should be laid in the dining-room from half-past eight onward, so that
      guests could go down whenever it so pleased them. To break up the
      continuity of the evening by a formal gathering around a supper table was
      opposed to Caroline's notions. Besides, irregularities in meals were one
      of the features of the house. You need never be in time, and there was
      always food when you wanted it. To the erratic and unregulated visitor it
      was paradise. Caroline paid her servants extra wages to insure
      satisfaction in this respect. So Clytie's little manouvre was quite in
      accordance with the recognised order of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found the dining-room unoccupied. She sat down near the end of the
      table, while Kent, a little way off, gravely carved some chicken, which he
      brought to her together with some salad and a jug of claret-cup. Then he
      sat down by her, at the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But aren't you going to eat anything yourself?&rdquo; she asked, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that doesn't matter. Do go and get something, to keep me in
      countenance. How can I eat when you are sitting watching me like that,
      with your elbow on the table?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done it so often before. It seemed natural to sit by you while you
      had your meal. I was forgetting. You see my manners have not improved.
      However&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose for the purpose of helping himself to some food, but Clytie
      stopped him, made him sit down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! It was silly of me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did not think of it. Don't be
      any different from what you used to be. Let us imagine that this evening
      is one of the old Sunday evenings here. Ah! If you only knew how glad I am
      to see you. What an eternity it has been since we met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen months,&rdquo; said Kent laconically. &ldquo;The longest eighteen months I h
      I have ever lived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think I have missed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; so much as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Kent!&rdquo; said Clytie, troubled. &ldquo;I wish I could do something for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, <i>es ist vorbei</i>,&rdquo; he said, puckering his brows, as he watched
      the rings he was making in the damask with an inverted wineglass. Then his
      forehead suddenly cleared, and he looked up with his frank laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I am just as much of a bear as ever. Instead of telling you what
      a delight it is to be with you again, I come to you complaining, and I
      ought to have every reason not to rail at fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are doing great things, I hear,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;Tell me about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are neither great nor much worth telling. The <i>opus</i> is
      being translated into German, and part of it will be soon published by the
      University of Vienna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a feather in your cap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A big one. I don't think I am given to running after notoriety and that
      sort of thing, but it is gratifying to be recognised a little. It
      encourages one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it does!&rdquo; said Clytie with more meaning than she intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I have been working away at it harder than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had your enthusiasm,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And your power of work. Do you
      remember your lectures?&rdquo; They talked a little about the old days, half
      sadly, half tenderly. Those memories were very pleasant. Then they came
      back to the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Winnie tells me you are a great man now at the Museum. I am so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent waved his hand deprecatingly and laughed. &ldquo;Winifred is quite an
      Iris,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;For she comes down to earth sometimes and tells me
      things about you. Yes, I am quite a man of affluence these days. I am the
      head of the department. I have got so much money I don't know what to do
      with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you employ some of it in giving yourself proper meals,&rdquo; said
      Clytie. &ldquo;Or do you still have your extraordinary suppers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I live just the same,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;If I began to be respectable in
      one thing, I should gradually become so in all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the rooms are just the same as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few more pictures and odds and ends. And I have got a carpet. That's
      Wither's doing. He came to see me in the winter and caught a cold, due to
      the bare boards, so he said. When he had recovered he made me go and buy a
      thick Turkey square. After that I had serious designs of forbidding him
      the rooms lest he should turn them into a boudoir altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed over this idea. Clytie asked him whether he still kept the
      tripods before the fireplace, and whether the paraffin oil can in the
      corner harmonised well with the carpet. It was like a breath of fresh air
      to meet Kent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he pointed to her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not eating anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not hungry,&rdquo; said Clytie with some demureness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you have not had your evening meal, you'll get faint. What did you
      come down for, if you merely wanted to pick at the wing of a chicken and
      to put hardly any of it into your mouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Clytie burst out into merry laughter. He was so downright and honest.
      Just the same as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you foolish Kent! I should have thought even you could have invented
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really want to see me?&rdquo; he asked, brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course! Do you suppose I am devoid of human attributes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought them nearer than they had been since the time that Kent
      realised he loved her. To Kent this meeting was enchantment. To see her
      sitting by him, bright, laughing, her old self, was enough to make him
      lose sense of the past eighteen months of hopeless longing. He thought to
      himself that it was better she had not learned, since her ignorance gave
      him this sweet half hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we must be going upstairs soon,&rdquo; she said, with a little
      wistful wrinkling of her forehead. &ldquo;When shall I see you again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent started at the question. It troubled him. He did not know what answer
      to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within less than another year, I hope,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Kent. We mustn't be strangers any more. It's not good for us.
      Would you care about seeing me very often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not coming to call upon you,&rdquo; he replied bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual words were ungracious. But there was a flash of eager longing
      in his eyes that lent the words a subtle meaning. And Clytie rose from the
      table with a little gasp of pain as the truth burst upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kent, Kent!&rdquo; she cried, greatly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met, and this time there was no mistake. He knew that she had
      guessed. But with a great effort he evaded the appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I can't come to your house to see you,&rdquo; he said huskily. &ldquo;There you
      are Mrs. Hammerdyke, and I shouldn't know you. Your home is full of
      interests and associations in which I could only be a stranger and an
      intruder. To me you are Clytie, the Clytie whose daily life I used to
      share&mdash;and only as Clytie can I bear to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it help you to see me as Clytie?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearly,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can always come in to the studio when I am with Winifred, and I
      shall always be here on Sunday evenings. Don't you think I want to see you
      too&mdash;as Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. Thank you,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, taking her hand. &ldquo;Now it
      is time for us to go upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ach lay awake that
      night, thinking. To Clytie the revelation of Kent's love was dazing. The
      sense of her own dulness in never having pierced the heart of his mystery
      was even more confounding. Why should she have divined suddenly the
      meaning of the light in his eyes, on this first meeting after their
      eighteen months of separation, when she had been blind to it before? She
      only half guessed as yet why he had not told her, but she saw that it must
      have arisen from a rare, strange delicacy in his nature differentiating
      him from all other men that she had known. Her heart went out in pity for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How he must have suffered!&rdquo; she repeated over and over to herself. And
      then scenes between them came before her mind and became clear in the
      light of this revelation: the strange suppressed interview after her
      arrival from Durdleham; the last evening he had spent in London before
      going abroad, when he had lit her fire, and she had gone up to bid him
      farewell. How had her ears been so dull as not to detect the tremor in his
      voice when, after kissing her hand, he had said: &ldquo;You are my very dear
      lady whom I will serve to the hour of my death&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then a little hissing snake of a thought formed itself into a reply;
      and she shrank up together with a slight convulsive shiver as if something
      foul had touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that she could not sleep. She got up, lit her candle, and took a
      book at random from her shelves. It was her well-worn, girlish Globe
      Shakespeare, one of the books she had surreptitiously procured when the
      family Bowdler was included in the category of formulas against which she
      revolted. She took it back to bed with her and commenced reading where it
      had chanced to open. The first words that met her eye seemed like a voice
      from the other world:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Such harmony is in immortal souls;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But while this muddy vesture of decay
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Doth grossly clothe it in, we cannot hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed so closely on the track of her own shuddering thought that
      she could read no more. She blew out her candle, and remained awake,
      staring into the darkness, until the gray dawn filtered through the
      blinds, and she fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Kent more restful. He had battled with his love, and with a strong
      man's will had brought it under subjection, making it minister to his
      happiness in spite of torturing longings instead of allowing it to darken
      his life. It had awakened him to a sense of a world of beautiful things,
      given him a deeper understanding and a wider sympathy than he had before.
      For him truly might it be said that to love her was a liberal education.
      It gave him the key to the knowledge and appreciation of women, drew him
      from his seclusion into the general society he had formerly avoided. A
      feminine conclusion which he would once have pooh-poohed as weak and
      illogical struck him now with its intuitive subtlety and delicacy of
      point. He learned that what the essentially feminine mind lacks in breadth
      it gains in fineness, and he was amazed to discover what a sensitive touch
      upon life is possessed by a cultivated woman. And mingled with this new
      charm was another of an esoteric kind. No woman he met had all the
      fascinations of Clytie, but every woman seemed to possess one of them. He
      confided this once in a roundabout way to Wither, who laughed, and told
      him he was growing too susceptible and would find himself married one of
      these days. But Kent shook his head. &ldquo;I could only find a Clytie among
      them by marrying the whole sex and making an extract of it,&rdquo; he said with
      conviction. For not only did the higher qualities of woman's nature
      manifest themselves to him, but the minor graces of manner and appearance
      appealed to that side of his aesthetic temperament that had hitherto been
      under a cloud. It occurred to him then that he had been living with half
      his faculties. Accordingly he felt a peculiar satisfaction in his new
      powers of perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had cost him a pang to forego the pleasure of the bright society that
      Mrs. Farquharson gathered round her. At first he had given up going to
      Harley Street through fear of meeting Clytie, for he shrank from meeting
      her under the new conditions. Then as time passed on, and he accustomed
      himself to the idea of Clytie as a married woman of fashion, he wished to
      go, but shyness held him back. It would look strange to resume visiting
      suddenly after his apparent rudeness and neglect. Probably the Farquharsons
      would never have seen him again had not George met him at a learned
      society's meeting, and given him a hearty and pressing invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a large though somewhat scattered society in which, although
      the rarest of visitors, he had always been welcome. And now he not only
      mixed assiduously in this, thereby causing many laughing conjectures as to
      the reason of his social reformation, but he volunteered occasionally to
      go out with Wither, whose circle of acquaintance, like Sam Weller's
      knowledge of London, was extensive and peculiar. A revolution was thus
      effected in Kent's habits, and to a certain extent in his mode of thought.
      A new zest was given to life in this enlargement of his horizon. And all
      through his love of Clytie. The awakening of the dormant sex principle had
      strengthened his nature, extended his humanity in depth and breadth. In
      spite of a hopeless, passionate love Kent was still a happy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now this spell of her influence was broken, or at least modified. He
      had seen her, felt the softness of her voice, the kindliness of her eyes.
      And he had unwittingly betrayed his secret. She knew that he loved her.
      She pitied him, promised that he should see her frequently on the basis of
      the old friendship. It was kind and generous, he thought, to step down
      from the height of her wedded felicity to comfort him with her friendship
      and sympathy. An unexpected happiness was in store for him. Perhaps, after
      all, his loyalty and devotion might be of some use to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But strong, loyal man as he was, this sudden meeting troubled him. If only
      he had spoken at once, before the other had come upon the scene, she might
      have been won to love him. The old torturing regrets came upon him, and he
      tossed sleeplessly on his bed. The love which, through its very
      hopelessness, had all these months given him peace and a measure of
      happiness now burst forth again tumultuously. It became a miserable farce
      to lie awake in the darkness. He rose, went into his sitting-room and lit
      the gas. Then he sat down at his writing space, and, burying his face in
      his hands, remained for some time in great pain of thought. At last his
      eye fell upon some notepaper lying invitingly on his blotting-pad. An idea
      struck him. He would write to her. He covered four sides with a passionate
      outburst of his love, writing wildly, unthinkingly, as men must write in
      moments of overpowering emotion. Then he tore up the sheet and began
      afresh. The summer morning light was streaming into the room through the
      curtainless window, mingling oddly with the yellow gas, when Kent enclosed
      and addressed the first letter to Clytie in which he told her of his love.
      He got up, stiff from his long sitting and somewhat exhausted, and going
      to bed, slept the sleep of the just until it was his usual hour for
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next afternoon when Clytie returned from a drive she found the letter
      awaiting her. She took it up to her room, and there, sitting on the edge
      of the bed, read it with conflicting feelings. It ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Clytie:
    </p>
    <p>
      You know my secret. I think so. I saw it in your face. But if I was
      mistaken, let me tell it to you in so many words; and as I bring to you
      what is best and truest in me, it will neither dishonour me to tell it nor
      you to hear it. And as you in your goodness offer me a resumption of the
      old friendship, I must say it once and for all. I love you, Clytie, with
      all the strength of a man who has allowed women to take up very little
      part in his life. I loved you long before I knew it. It grew up gradually
      during our intercourse, and only one day when you were at Durdleham a
      little, little chance circumstance revealed to me that you were not only
      the grand, sweet friend, but the woman that I passionately loved. And I
      could not tell you for fear of paining you and destroying our friendship&mdash;for
      what was I to love you? And I dreaded lest you should think me disloyal to
      the trust between us. And at last I came, resolved to speak, and it was
      too late. Winifred can tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that time I have carried my love with me as the vivifying principle
      of my life. I thought you would never know, but now I have betrayed
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will it not pain you too much in your present happiness to see me under
      this new guise? Ah, Clytie! tell me frankly as you always used to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall never, never willingly trouble the serenity of your life. I love
      you too sincerely, too devotedly; and my love makes me myself too happy.
      If you will meet me now and again after this, freely, at the houses of our
      common friends, you shall only see the old Kent who now and then scolded
      you, sometimes helped you, and who always held you dearer and higher and
      grander than all other women; and yet you must let yourself be loved&mdash;that
      I cannot help. It is fused into my being, and it gives me happiness in my
      own way. I am an oddity, you know, Clytie, as you yourself have called me,
      and oddities have their little privileges, and if you know that it makes
      my happiness, and does not grudge you yours, you will not find it hard to
      be loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were a woman of ordinary conventional ideas, I could not tell you
      this. You would misunderstand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seems but little I could do for you&mdash;and I would do so much.
      But life is full of strange chances, and perhaps my chance of serving you
      may come, and would then I could die for you to save you an hour's pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours in all devotion,
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie read the letter over several times. At first the tears came into
      her eyes and a lump rose in her throat. This simple, unrequiring love
      soothed her and smote her at once. The largeness and tenderness of the
      man's nature came to her almost as a revelation. What was there in her
      worthy of this sacrifice? How could she tell him, she thought in her
      broken pride, that she had failed miserably, wretchedly, that she had
      forsaken the higher for the lower, that this selfless love of his was as
      far above the sudden intoxication that had degraded her as the spirit is
      above the flesh? She had thrown away the best, like the shepherd in the
      German legend, who, in the sensuous heart-leap at the sight of the
      glittering treasure, disregarded the voice, &ldquo;Forget not the best,&rdquo; and
      dropped and trampled underfoot the little blue flower that opened the
      enchanted hillside. How could she tell him that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, too, the note of unconscious irony in his letter jarred through her
      painfully. &ldquo;Her present happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she cried at last. &ldquo;If he only knew how much need I have of
      happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the strength that had kept the tears back for all these latter
      months of weariness and disillusion suddenly forsook her, and turning as
      she sat, she threw herself on the bed in a great agony of sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later she wrote Kent the following reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      My Dear Friend Kent:
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not worthy of such devotion. I can only wonder at it and accept it
      humbly and gratefully. Words like these of yours I never could
      misunderstand, Kent. If it is a pleasure to you to see me, you need not
      shun me any more. Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent went into the studio on Monday to tell Winifred of the meeting; on
      Tuesday, with a vague hope of seeing Clytie; on Wednesday, when Winifred
      herself expected her, but she did not come. On Thursday, however, he heard
      her voice from outside the studio door, and his heart gave a great throb.
      He entered and found himself once more in her presence. Neither spoke of
      the letters that had passed between them, but the faintest pressure of the
      hand and a glance from her eyes told him that she understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that they met frequently&mdash;on Sunday evenings at the
      Farquharsons', during the week in the studio, where for some months Clytie
      had taken to coming very frequently for the comfort of seeing Winifred.
      Clytie maintained her usual habits; Kent, as far as was possible, resumed
      his old ones. Sometimes it was strangely like the old days. With a little
      longing, perhaps, to add to the illusion, and also to give herself some
      employment while Winifred worked, Clytie began a picture, choosing in a
      humorous tenderness to take Winnie as her model. The picture never was
      completed, for Clytie had not the temperament to do justice to the slender
      figure in its quiet summer dress, and to the soft, dark face bent so
      earnestly over the palette and sheaf of brushes. But while the painting of
      it lasted it gave a comfortable air of reality to the revival. It was new
      life to Kent to come in on his return and once more receive Clytie's
      friendly nod as she stood by the easel, a painting-apron over her dainty
      dress, and her hands smudged with charcoal or daubs of paint. He did not
      think much of the portrait, and he told her so with laughing frankness.
      But he divined why she was doing it, and while criticising, encouraged her
      to proceed. His arrival, however, as it always had been, was a signal for
      the cessation of work. Then Winifred cleaned the brushes and put them in
      the trays, and gathered up the tubes and rags which Clytie, with less
      sense of tidiness, had strewed around her, and Clytie drew out the
      basket-table and rang the bell for Mrs. Gurkins to bring up the tea.
      Clytie had left behind her all her small domestic articles for Winnie's
      use in the studio. So there was the familiar tea-service, the Crown-Derby
      cups and apostle spoons,&mdash;a piece of wicked extravagance on Clytie's
      part in times gone by,&mdash;the gray Japanese teapot whose wicker handle
      had still to be delicately fingered, and the little glass sugar-bowl that
      looked so plebeian beside the aristocratic porcelain. Scarcely anything in
      the studio had been changed. The charcoal caricatures on the walls were as
      sacred in Winifred's eyes as if they had been frescoes by old Italian
      masters, and she had issued strict injunctions to spring-cleaners to leave
      them intact. Even Clytie's easel was there now. Kent lived for these
      afternoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Kent was going to dine with Wither and Fairfax. As his road to a
      certain point was the same as Clytie's, they walked along together. This
      was almost the first occasion on which they were quite alone together. He
      reminded her casually of the fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;And I have been wanting to see you by yourself. I
      have not thanked you for your letter. But you do see that I appreciate it,
      don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing to thank me for, since I pleased myself in writing it.
      The thanks are from me to you for treating it as you have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Clytie, shaking her head and looking before her. &ldquo;You can't
      understand,&mdash;and perhaps it is better you shouldn't,&mdash;what a
      letter like that means to a woman. Well, it meant a great deal to me. To
      tell you so is the only return I can make you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let us talk of it,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;I could not bear to have you as a
      friend under false pretences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After they had walked a few steps in silence she continued the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think it would be better for you to forget all about me, and
      look around for someone who can make you happy&mdash;really happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd have to live till the day of judgment to find her,&rdquo; said Kent
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's ridiculous, Kent. But can't you feel that it sometimes pains me to
      see you sacrificing your life for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sacrificing my life,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully. &ldquo;Besides, I don't
      quite see what it has got to do with you&mdash;in one sense. I love you,
      and I couldn't love anybody else for all the joys in creation. Thank God,
      you are broad-minded enough to let me tell you this without any chance of
      misconstruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! That's all very well,&rdquo; she said, with a little sigh. &ldquo;If I were a
      saint, I might placidly accept it as my due. Being only a woman, and that
      none of the best, it seems such a waste of good love, Kent, and love is a
      rare, rare thing in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it would go a-begging if you did not have it,&rdquo; he replied, laughing.
      &ldquo;Come, don't let us say anything more about it. You are happy with your
      own home and interests, and I am happy in seeing you and having your
      friendship. Of course I have suffered a bit, but it's all over now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Life seems to be made up of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved an energetic protest with his ash stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since when have <i>you</i> grown a pessimist? I don't believe in it. Life
      is made up of responsibilities and interests. There's suffering in it of
      course; but there are alleviations. It's like cold and frost. If you stood
      up without a rag on in the snow you'd think the world was made of nothing
      else but frost. But you put on warm clothing and defy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the poor, ill-clad, shivering wretches&mdash;what about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm talking of people with average material wealth,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;That's
      just it. So can the people of ordinary moral wealth clothe themselves
      against suffering. I don't like the morbid view of things. It doesn't do
      any good. Do you remember a passage in Longfellow's 'Hyperion'&mdash;a
      criticism of two German poets&mdash;'melancholy gentlemen to whom life was
      only a dismal swamp, upon whose margin they walked with cambric
      handkerchiefs in their hands, sobbing and sighing, and making signals to
      Death to come and ferry them over the lake'? It's a bit fierce on your
      pessimists; but it's a wholesome little passage to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little while after this they parted. Kent walked on, swinging his stick,
      convinced of Clytie's happiness, yet wondering at her unusual note of
      pessimism, and Clytie called a cab, as she was late, and drove home with a
      world of strange and troubling thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of August Clytie received a visit from the boy Jack, who had
      just come to London for his summer holiday. He had grown greatly during
      the past year, had filled out. The taint of the street had gone from him
      and he was becoming civilised. Clytie leaned back in her chair and looked
      at him curiously as he sat, in all the self-consciousness of a newly
      awakened sense of propriety, upon the edge of his seat, twirling his
      glengarry cap. As an artistic object he had deteriorated. The motive of
      his worth in that respect had gone with the picturesqueness of his old
      garments and dirt and wild elf locks; but he was handsome in spite of his
      cropped brown hair and the severity of his attire. Indeed there was
      something incongruous in the corduroy uniform and the refinement of his
      face, with its bright dark eyes and finely cut lips that disclosed a
      perfect row of white, even teeth. And yet there was cruelty around the
      mouth, the sublimated essence of the fierce savagery that Clytie had
      impressed upon her famous picture. He had been transformed from the animal
      into the human being, it is true; but that does not necessarily imply that
      the human being does not retain many of the passions of the animal. With
      the old Jack the untamable was degradingly confused with lowness, but it
      shone out all the clearer now by reason of the humanising of his face.
      Clytie noted all this as they talked together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are getting quite a man,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When are you leaving school?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Kent says I'm to stay there another year,&rdquo; replied Jack. &ldquo;Then I'm to
      be 'prenticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a joiner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Jack. And after he had scraped a little with his toe
      on the ground he looked up and added: &ldquo;Do you think I needn't be a joiner
      if I didn't want to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see why you shouldn't be what you like, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; and his face brightened. &ldquo;I have been thinking I should like to
      be something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A carver and gilder,&rdquo; said Jack bashfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do the especial charms of that trade come in?&rdquo; asked Clytie,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;I only thought it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a touch of pique in his voice. Clytie noticed it, saw that she
      had wounded susceptibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Jack, why you want to be a carver and gilder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could make all the picture-frames for you and Miss Marchpane,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Jack,&rdquo; said Clytie, touched at the boyish idea. &ldquo;But perhaps
      we'll make you something better than a carver or gilder. I don't know what
      you could be. What could we make of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A vague idea of raising Jack above the artisan level had occurred to her
      during her scrutiny of his face. He was not an ordinary creature. That he
      should spend his life in the dull, commonplace atmosphere of the British
      workman seemed a waste of possibilities. There are millions who possess
      just the qualifications for hewers of wood and drawers of water. Why
      should a finer organisation not be cultivated, trained, put into an
      environment where there are conditions for free development? But whether
      the boy was a potential admiral, Lord Chancellor, or novelist she could
      not determine. That was why she asked the question, &ldquo;What could we make of
      you?&rdquo; somewhat pathetically. Jack shook his head in reply. He had learned
      at school that life was a serious thing terminating in apprenticeship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to learn a trade,&rdquo; he replied after a little, &ldquo;and I'd sooner be
      a carver and gilder than anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose a good fairy were to come, Jack,&rdquo; persisted Clytie, &ldquo;and say
      that you were not to learn a trade, or that, if you did begin, you would
      work your way out of it, and become a great man, and do glorious things in
      the world&mdash;suppose you were able to choose to be anything you liked&mdash;what
      do you think you would be? Tell me&mdash;something great and bright and
      noble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had grown animated with her enthusiasm, and leaned forward, with her
      chin raised and lips parted&mdash;her attitude in moments of exaltation.
      The boy looked at her for a few seconds, catching her spirit. Something
      was at work within him too, for his eyes glowed, and his breath came
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something, Jack. Tell me what it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to be a soldier like my father,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, the
      extravagant, glowing fancies that had haunted him for six months thus
      finding half-choked expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; asked Clytie, taken aback, and diverging into the side
      track of her astonishment. &ldquo;I never knew you had&mdash;I mean, I thought
      you did not know anything at all about him. You used not to tell me the
      truth, then, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! but I did not know then!&rdquo; he cried eagerly. &ldquo;It was only when I come
      here at Christmas, and you was ill, so I couldn't tell you. He was a
      soldier, my father, an orficer. And I would like to be an orficer too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Jack, this is very interesting,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;Aren't you pleased
      to have a father you can be proud of? Was he a very brave man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a sword,&rdquo; said Jack proudly, as if that was proof positive of
      valour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down in your old place on the hearthrug and tell me all
      about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy did as he was bidden, sinking somewhat shyly at first on to the
      great bearskin at Clytie's feet. But after a while he huddled himself up
      in his old posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother didn't tell me much,&rdquo; he said in answer to a question of Clytie's.
      &ldquo;I was looking in a chest of drawers of mother's, and I see a photograph&mdash;an
      orficer&mdash;all over strings and buttons and a sword and great big
      moustaches. And I come to mother and says: 'Who's this?' and she says:
      'That's your father.' And then she snatched it out of my hand and hit me a
      clout on the head for going to her drawer. She wouldn't tell me no mere;
      but I know he was an orficer because he's got a star on his collar. I
      think I knows orficers when I sees them,&rdquo; he added, with the ci-devant
      street urchin's knowledge of life. &ldquo;And I go and look at him now when
      mother isn't by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you shouldn't go to your mother's private drawers,&rdquo; said Clytie by
      way of moral precept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got as much right to look at my father as she has,&rdquo; replied Jack in
      an injured tone, whereat Clytie laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an odd youth. I wish I could make you an officer right away. But
      I am afraid I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you could,&rdquo; said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a world of childish faith in the remark and the manner in which
      it was delivered. Clytie was both touched and saddened. She regretted that
      she had raised hopes in the boy that from the nature of things were doomed
      to disappointment. The overpowering difficulties in the way of her sudden
      visionary aspirations for Jack's future ranged themselves before her mind.
      So it was with a sigh she answered his outburst of faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I can't, Jack,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;But you yourself can do a
      great deal. If you like, one of these days when you are much older, you
      can enlist in the army, and then throw your soul into your duties, and
      keep before you at every minute of the day the words, 'I am going to be an
      officer,' and if you do this intensely, and never lose sight of it, you
      will succeed. That's the only way. They call it getting a commission
      through the ranks. But between now and then there are a great many years,
      and I'll do all I can for you, Jack. Yet, perhaps, after all, you'd be a
      happier and more useful man as a carver and gilder. Who knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack did not heed the pessimism of the peroration. His mind was aflame
      with the possibilities of becoming an officer and he took his leave in
      high spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie sat for a little musing over the solution of the problem that had
      troubled her in the first days of her acquaintance with Jack. She was
      gratified at her intuitions having proved correct. But there was still
      much that was dark to her. The physiological side of the question,
      however, was shadowed at present by more practical considerations. Why
      could she not find a means of giving Jack a chance in life? She looked
      ahead at the years to come, as she often had done since that dark December
      morning, and a pain came at her heart as she beheld their blankness. And
      now fate had thrown across her path this drifting spar of humanity. Jack
      was hers if she chose to claim him. No one would dispute with her the
      privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      After luncheon she walked to the King's Road and sat with Winifred, in the
      hope that Kent would look in on his way upstairs. She wanted to take
      counsel with him. His sturdy common sense would help her. She did not
      confide her vague scheme to Winifred, because Winifred would have called
      her a darling, and put her arms round her neck, and made her feel as if
      she were meditating something peculiarly noble. So she waited for Kent's
      sobering presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came in at his customary hour, bearing a paper bag of peaches which he
      had brought for Winifred. He had carried them from some distance through
      the streets, and there were little wet stains on the paper. But when the
      fruit was put on a plate beside the bread and butter on a flap of the
      wickerwork afternoon tea table it looked fresh and inviting. This sudden
      return of their old intimacy was delightful to all three of them, and they
      chatted during tea as if nothing had happened to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Clytie propounded her case, and they formed themselves into a
      committee to consider it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like social experiments,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;It's constituting one's
      self a Providence without Providence's resources. If one bit of the
      machinery fails, the whole thing is apt to go wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't want to experiment!&rdquo; cried Clytie. &ldquo;It's quite wicked of you
      to say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can it be otherwise?&rdquo; asked Kent. &ldquo;You want to put an industrial
      school boy of the most unconventional type and upbringing into the most
      caste-bound, conventional profession under the sun. It's like putting a
      bit of metallic sodium into water. A pretty experiment, though rather
      common; but the result is an explosion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he must be trained and made a gentleman first,&rdquo; cried Winifred,
      coming to Clytie's assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;Should he ever be able to get into the army, he
      will be by that time quite a different being to what he is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll have to give him a rigid, conventional training, and so spoil
      him,&rdquo; said Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't spoil him to learn to speak the Queen's English and the use
      of his knife and, fork,&rdquo; said Clytie a little defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd have to learn more than that. Besides, how is he to be taught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I've come to you for advice about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent mused for a moment and stroked his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you very much bent upon this?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can only see one way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;and that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adopt him,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;An industrial school boy can be run by a
      committee&mdash;the experiment is not very dangerous, but a conventional
      gentleman must have conventional references.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His first words struck the chord she had shrunk from striking herself. It
      was the formulated suggestion of a vague desire. She was silent for a
      little. Then Winifred in response to a business summons went out on to the
      landing, and Kent and Clytie were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have been too downright and have hurt you,&rdquo; he said
      concernedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head and glanced at him smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to you for common sense. You have given it me. And your conclusion
      is one that I dared not come to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you should adopt him? A <i>reductio ad absurdum!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I feel it. I am not my own mistress now There are difficulties. Oh,
      Kent, don't let me talk of them! You see, I came to you for help&mdash;to
      no one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't quite understand you, Clytie,&rdquo; said Kent, anxious at her sudden
      agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recovered herself, womanlike, and forced a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were a rich, lonely old woman, I might be able,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but, you
      see, I'm not. No, no, I can't adopt Jack; and we'll have to run him by a
      committee, whatever happens to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you decided?&rdquo; asked Winifred, coming into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That it will be fairer to Jack to let him work out his own salvation,&rdquo;
       said Kent. &ldquo;Let him work his way through the ranks. If there is anything
      in him it will come out. You don't think me unkind, do you, Clytie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereat Clytie laughed honestly and Kent received much consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked a little longer, on indifferent subjects, and then at
      Winifred's hour of departure they all rose together. Winifred went to the
      back of the studio and put on her hat; Clytie and Kent moved slowly in the
      direction of the door. Kent sighed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only seem to have seen you for five minutes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I have told
      you nothing, but given you commonplace advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had you so much to tell me?&rdquo; she asked, smiling, as his unformulated wish
      echoed within herself. &ldquo;There is no reason for us to go away because
      Winifred does. Would you really like to stay a little and talk to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Kent spoke Clytie had not the faintest thought of doing this. But
      in a flash came before her the long evening she was to spend in the great
      lonely house. Thornton rarely came home for dinner. He even dressed at his
      club. Often he slept there. On such occasions the first notice Clytie
      received of his absence was from the inscrutable butler, who would come
      into the studio in the morning with: &ldquo;The commissionnaire for master's
      letters, ma'am.&rdquo; Occasionally three days passed without their meeting.
      When they did pass an hour in each other's company sometimes there was
      calm and sometimes storm. It depended upon his mood. As a general rule he
      was polite, even bright and entertaining, and life with him under these
      conditions was just bearable. But now the thought came with some
      bitterness: What did it matter whether she was at home by seven or eight&mdash;or
      twelve, for that matter? Why should she not have a cheery hour with Kent?
    </p>
    <p>
      His face brightened as she made her smiling offer to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too good of you. Of course I should like to have a talk with you.
      But you&mdash;can you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she interrupted lightly. &ldquo;I am not due home at any hour. I want
      to chat with you myself. Winnie dear, we are going to remain a little.
      Give me the key and I'll hand it to Mrs. Gurkins as I go down. I haven't
      asked you, but I suppose we can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, darling,&rdquo; said Winnie, coming up and giving her a
      farewell kiss. &ldquo;I hate to think the studio isn't yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Winifred went away and they remained as in the old days. The sudden
      association gave Clytie a pang. A reaction from her enthusiasm about Jack
      to weariness of spirit made her sink back listlessly in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Kent, filling his pipe. &ldquo;You are not looking
      yourself. It is this steaming London. Why don't you go and get some
      country air?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, one place is just the same as another. It isn't London and it isn't
      the weather. It is the world that is out of joint, somehow. I am afraid I
      have been moping. I think I shall invest in a cat. Then I can pour out my
      grievances to it. That's the best of a cat: it never mopes. It goes on
      purring cheerfully so long as it's warm and well fed, and when you feel
      paradoxical it never worries you to explain yourself. Do you like cats? I
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you moping about?&rdquo; he asked between the first few puffs of his
      kindling pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't talk in that aggressively cheerful tone, Kent. I have come on
      all over moods, and I want comforting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should work,&rdquo; replied Kent with some self-restraint. &ldquo;You have hardly
      touched a brush in earnest this year. It is the claims of that part of
      your nature that cry out if they are not satisfied. Why don't you go on
      painting? What has the fact of your not having to make your living got to
      do with your art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything, in a way,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't believe it,&rdquo; said Kent earnestly. &ldquo;You are not the woman to
      neglect your art out of pure idleness. Come, Clytie, rouse yourself and
      paint a great picture. The 'Faustina'&mdash;what has become of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't, don't!&rdquo; she cried, putting her hands up before her face. &ldquo;I
      can't do that now&mdash;can't think of it. Years hence, perhaps, when I am
      a middle-aged woman, if I find it good enough to live till then, I may try&mdash;but
      not now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent laid down his pipe and drew his chair near to her. He was pained and
      troubled. He saw that her nerves were a little unstrung; but the Clytie he
      knew was the last woman in the world to give way to attacks of this kind.
      And then a dreary conjecture dawned upon him, and his heart sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor Clytie!&rdquo; he said in his kind way. &ldquo;You seem unhappy. I wish I
      could do something to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it's too late now,&rdquo; she said impulsively, scarcely heeding the
      purport of her words. &ldquo;You might have done it eighteen months ago&mdash;if
      you had not been quixotic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, more and more troubled and at fault.
      &ldquo;Eighteen months ago? How could I have helped you? I loved you and hid it
      from you. I could only have caused you pain. I love you now. I don't hide
      it. Why should I? I am ready to help you if I can. I am stronger, wiser
      now than I was then. How could I have helped you then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simplicity of his short, reiterative sentences and the sincerity of
      his tone went to her heart, &ldquo;You could have helped me then by not hiding
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How could the knowledge that I loved you
      have helped you, unless you cared for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I might have cared for you,&rdquo; she said wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God, Clytie! don't say that. It is cruel!&rdquo; he cried, starting to his
      feet in great agitation. &ldquo;I know I acted like a fool, but it was with true
      motives. Don't twit me with them. It is more than I can bear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only then did Clytie clearly realise what she had been saying. The fit of
      supreme dejection passed off as suddenly as it had come, and she felt
      keenly the justice of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kent, Kent, forgive me!&rdquo; she cried, with starting tears. &ldquo;I hardly
      knew what I was saying. You are so noble and true-hearted that you must
      forgive me. Sometimes when a woman is wretched she has not control over
      herself, and I am sometimes very, very wretched, Kent. I was thinking of
      myself more than of you when I said the thing that pained you. Tell me
      that you forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appeal was too human, too unreserved, to be rejected by Kent's tender
      nature. He sat down again by her and took her hand and kissed it gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never seen you like this before,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish I could comfort
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew that it was no passing irritation or weariness that forced the
      confession from Clytie's proud nature. It was something deep and final&mdash;something
      impossible in her married life. Her wretchedness made him forget his own
      longing in the desire to be of use to her and lighten her lot. He let go
      her hand, which she allowed to lie on her lap as it fell, with the palms
      lightly upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why I have told you this to-day,&rdquo; she said, not meeting his
      eyes. &ldquo;I have never breathed it or hinted it to a living being, and it
      came upon me unawares. Don't despise me, Kent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I know what any outsider would say. I was posing as the <i>femme
      incomprise</i>. I was casting away my womanly pride. Of all persons in the
      world <i>you</i> ought not to have been my confidant. Judged by
      conventional canons I am to be despised, for what can the world say of a
      woman who tells a man that still loves her that she regrets she did not
      marry him? Oh, don't interrupt me. I may as well speak out my true self
      once and for all to you. You yourself once remarked that if we were
      superior to conventionalities of habit, we ought to extend our
      unconventionalities to sentiment. You are loyal and staunch. You can help
      me by being my friend, for I have no one else to turn to. My life is a
      dreary mistake. My art does not satisfy me, because I have no hopes. One
      must have enthusiasms to be an artist, and all mine are dead. Now you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a certain fierce pleasure in this self-abasement. It was like
      the vengeance of her higher nature upon her lower, the whip of scorn
      applied by the spirit to the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer, but looked at her with inexpressible sadness in his
      eyes. She added a few more words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you despise me for telling you, let me know at once. It would be
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;I shall never apply to you the
      conventional canons of misjudgment. I take what you have said to me as a
      sacred trust, and thank you from my heart for thinking well enough of me
      to give me your confidence. You must never ask me such a question again,
      Clytie, for it would wound me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, Kent,&rdquo; she said, raising her eyes to his in her frank
      manner. &ldquo;And I was wrong to say you <i>might</i> have helped me, for you
      can now. And you will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With my last breath,&rdquo; said Kent simply. &ldquo;It has been the torturing regret
      of the last eighteen months that, much as I wished, I could never do a
      hand's turn for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what can I do for you in repayment, my poor Kent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be your own bright, eager self again. Throw yourself into your painting,
      and the result I will take as my reward. It will be my influence gleaming
      through your genius, and it will be sweet to me. Oh, Clytie! you are
      wrong. A life is seldom so wrecked that it cannot be reconstructed, for
      that implies the utter loss of faith. A grain of faith in anything can
      move mountains; if one hasn't it, then it is time to put an end to life
      altogether, it becomes one's duty not to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came within an ace of that at the beginning of the year,&rdquo; said Clytie,
      with a sad retrospective smile. &ldquo;Some time I may tell you why. I thought
      of dying, but then it seemed cowardly. Perhaps it was I had more curiosity
      to go on seeing how the world went on than I was aware of. And now, Kent,
      you have put things in a new light before me, and how can I thank you for
      all your goodness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you,&rdquo; he replied, with a smile.

      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning,
      after writing her letters and attending to her household duties, Clytie
      went into her studio with the praiseworthy intention of stimulating the
      artistic impulse that had been flagging for so long. Kent was right, she
      thought. Her life could be reconstructed. She would begin her laborious
      art life again, resume it seriously as a profession, put her pictures into
      the market once more. Amid the many confusing thoughts and emotions
      resulting from her conversation with Kent, one idea had sprung in
      connection with Jack. She could not adopt the boy. That was a wild
      feminine craving, somewhat selfish, springing out of a bitter hour when
      fairer hopes were crushed. It cost her a sigh to resign; but she trusted
      to Kent's judgment, and her mind was so far at rest. Yet if it could lie
      in her power to help Jack materially in after years, when a little capital
      would be worth all the world to him, she felt that she would have wrought
      some good for one human creature at least in her somewhat self-centred
      life. And then Kent's advice as to her art mingled and combined with these
      thoughts, and the outcome was the sudden idea that the proceeds of the
      sale of her pictures would, in course of time, form a very considerable
      fund. She clapped her hands with delight when this occurred to her. A
      mountain of weariness seemed removed. In the spontaneity of new workings
      she scribbled a hasty line to Kent and had it posted with the address
      scarcely dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to paint <i>seriously</i>, and <i>sell</i> my pictures, and
      devote the proceeds to a fund for Jack. Shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was in bright spirits this morning, having discovered an object in
      life. The future has generally much more to do with our present moods than
      the past. Yet, notwithstanding this broad truth, the immediate past had a
      certain influence on Clytie's humour. Whilst she was driving home the
      afternoon before, the gravity of the fact of her confession to Kent had
      somewhat weighed upon her. She had spent the lonely evening grappling with
      a truth that had been taking half-reluctant shape in her consciousness for
      the last two months, and now rose clear and sharply defined. She had even
      written to Kent the following portion of a letter which she straightway
      tore up into the finest of pieces. In fact her intention of sending it to
      him was from the first of the very remotest. &ldquo;My dear Kent,&rdquo; ran this
      singularly feminine effusion. &ldquo;My words to-day were true. If you had told
      me you loved me eighteen months ago, I should have realised myself and
      what it was that I felt towards you. The knowledge of her own heart does
      not come to a woman with the easy grace that your sentimentalists make
      out. It is somewhat of a fierce process, Kent. There is no royal road to
      it. Well, I know my own heart now, and I have bought the knowledge with
      agonies of suffering. Oh, Kent, my true, loyal Kent! I am tired, tired of
      hiding facts from myself, of acting in a wilful dream, in defiance of the
      promptings of my reason. I am a woman, and I ought not to confess things
      to myself, let alone to you. So people say&mdash;and people are so wise,
      aren't they? I love you, Kent. There, I write it down in black and white.
      It looks odd, grotesque, horrible, and yet wonderfully comforting. I love
      you, Kent. Why should I deceive myself any longer? God knows whether it is
      for my happiness in the future or my misery; but now that the beauty of it
      is upon me it makes me wonderfully happy. Yes, wonderfully, wonderfully,
      wonderfully happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she threw down her pen and shredded the paper with frenzied zeal.
      But her heart was lighter. The world seemed a clearer, pleasanter place.
      Her cheeks burned like fire at the thought of Kent ever knowing of this
      feeling. She arranged in her mind the tenderest and most elusive of
      relations between Kent and herself. He, a declared lover, should give her
      all the comfort and kind counsel of a friend; she, his declared friend,
      would find delicate, subtle ways of colouring and softening his life with
      her love. A new paradise of exquisite emotion opened its evanescent
      portals. For the first time in her life came the romance of delicate
      sentiment, tinged with an innocent pink like the buds in spring. It is
      true these same buds, to continue the analogy, burst into gorgeous,
      riotous bloom under the summer sun; but while the tenderer air of spring
      keeps them closed they have a grace peculiarly their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie moved about the studio singing, a sign with her of great content.
      The window was open and the morning sun streamed in, filling the large and
      somewhat heavily tapestried room with gay light. It glorified Clytie as
      she passed across the patch of sunlight, falling upon her hair in a
      thousand scintillations and revealing the deep sea-blue of her eyes. She
      wore a soft cream morning gown, a golden tasselled girdle round her waist,
      an edging of old lace round the somewhat open neck. The wide, drooping
      sleeves she had caught up a little for convenience in working, and her
      arms were bare to the elbow. The skirt clung around her as she walked
      quickly about the room, with her old elastic tread, making a soft
      frou-frou that pleased her, she did not know why. She was happy again,
      filled with a double sense of the meaning of life. At last she sat down
      before a small easel, on which was put the board with its fair sheet of
      Whatman paper ready for the first sketch. In her rapid, eager way she
      commenced to indicate the motive of the picture that had flashed like an
      inspiration upon her. In the middle distance on the left a pair of lovers,
      the woman looking with upturned face at the man, whose arm was round her
      waist. In the foreground, peeping at them from behind a clump of bushes, a
      girl of about seventeen, with a letter in her hand. The contrast between
      the two female faces was the motive&mdash;the fulfilment of knowledge on
      the one, the dawning revelation on the other. The title had come with the
      conception: &ldquo;Maiden and Woman.&rdquo; Clytie worked on steadily with her <i>ébauche</i>,
      keen, sure of herself, tingling once again with the excitement of
      inspiration. She knew she could put that in their faces which would raise
      the picture above the narrative prettiness of Sant and his school. The
      accessories were to be severe to austerity. No elaborate detail in tree
      painting, no subtle effects of light and shade. The principle of
      abstraction to be as uncompromisingly carried out as in one of Seymour
      Haden's etchings. The whole artistic force of the picture was to be
      concentrated in the awakened and awakening souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was absorbed in her work when, after a tap at the door, Jack came in.
      Clytie looked up with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here again, Jack! That is good of you. But I can't say a word to you&mdash;positively.
      I am so busy. Sit down somewhere until I have finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy, used to these fits of absorption in his two artist patronesses,
      sat down for a little and let his eyes wander round the studio, looking at
      the pictures and nicknacks. Then he got up to make a closer examination of
      vases and photographs, and walked about on tiptoe, trying to still the
      noise of his iron-shod boots against the hard, polished floor. At last he
      discovered on the bookshelves an illustrated History of England, with
      which he retired to his favourite place on the hearthrug. And so they
      remained for half an hour without saying a word&mdash;Clytie bending over
      her study, Jack curled up with his picture-book. It was quite still. A
      stray bumble-bee looked in now and then at the window, buzzing
      querulously, as if he had lost his way in London, and then darted off
      again. From the servants' hall came the just perceptible voice of one of
      the maids singing a hymn-tune, and from far, far away came the tinkling
      treble of a piano-organ. And these few sounds, so faint yet so clear,
      accentuated the summer stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Clytie had put the last few touches on the portion of her work that
      demanded all her concentration, she gave a little sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of that, Jack?&rdquo; she said, leaning back with her head
      critically aslant. &ldquo;Don't you think that is going to make a famous
      picture?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack jumped up promptly, leaving his book open on the hearthrug, and came
      up to her side. He was not a connoisseur, in spite of his associations
      with art, so he said nothing, but grinned appreciatively, rubbing the calf
      of one leg with the instep of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Clytie, &ldquo;why don't you admire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aint given them no faces,&rdquo; said Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! This is to be one face,&rdquo; she said, pointing to a kind of <i>remarque</i>
      at the foot of the sheet. &ldquo;Or something like it. Now just use your
      imagination, Jack. This face is to go there&mdash;the woman whose whole
      nature has been awakened, and is shining out of her eyes, and quivering on
      her lips, and is vibrating all through her frame&mdash;all of which is
      Greek and Chaldee to you, my good Jack; but I may as well explain. And now
      I have got to fix a face for this one. What kind of face do you think I am
      going to give her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; murmured Jack. And then after a slight pause: &ldquo;And what's the
      man going to be like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Clytie with a mock sigh. &ldquo;What a little Philistine you are! The
      man can be any kind of creature on two legs. What does it matter about the
      man? He is a nuisance. I have a good mind to make him awfully ugly with a
      face like a rhinoceros. See, like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a few rapid strokes with her charcoal in the oval left for the
      man's face, and the result was a picturesque monster with a long nose,
      Mephistophelian eyebrows, and a moustache curling up to his ears. Then
      they both burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me draw some funny men for you,&rdquo; she said in the light-hearted
      buoyancy of her mood. &ldquo;Run and get me that sheet of paper over there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pinned the sheet that Jack brought her on to the board and began to
      draw caricatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall choose one for me to put in the picture, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a long, long time since she had indulged this freakish side of her
      genius. It ran riot now in grotesque exuberance. Here a head with wide,
      leering mouth and pointed ears, like the devil that looks over Lincoln;
      there a snouted monster with cat's whiskers, an eyeglass, and a silk hat;
      a lean, cadaverous, equine face with a terrible squint; a masher,
      indicated by three or four little dots and lines. Jack looked on in
      rapture. She had never drawn pictures for him before. He broke out now and
      then into breathless exclamations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, he's an ugly one! Give him a long nose&mdash;longer than that; and,
      my eye! that's a wart upon it. One of the teachers at school has a wart on
      his nose. That's just like him! And where's this one's 'ed?&mdash;he's all
      body and legs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he jumped and clapped his hands when the head was seen to emerge
      from between the knees after the fashion of the boneless wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had filled up the last space on the sheet she tossed the charcoal
      into the tray, and rose from her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Jack! There's nothing like going absolutely mad on occasions. Now
      if you'd like to keep these pictures and show them to the boys at school,
      you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rolled up the stiff piece of drawing paper, slipped an elastic band
      round it in her hasty way, and gave it to Jack, who could only look his
      delighted thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I must go and wash my hands and get decent for lunch. Go downstairs
      and tell Mrs. Pawkins to give you something to eat. Stay&mdash;you had
      better leave that roll up here; come in for it before you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it from him, and laid it on a little table near the door. She did
      not desire that the inquisitive eyes in the servants' hall should witness
      the mistress's frivolity. Jack understood her more or less, but Mrs.
      Pawkins and Mary and John would have questioned her sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack lingered for a moment on the threshold, and then drew shyly from his
      handkerchief pocket a dingy, whitey-brown packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to show you this,&rdquo; he said, putting it into her hand. &ldquo;I prigged
      it from mother's drawer this morning. You'll give it me back, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a good mind not to,&rdquo; said Clytie severely. &ldquo;If your mother knew,
      she would be very angry, and you would catch it. Still, as you have been a
      good boy, I'll look at it and give it you back. Run away, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack did as he was bid, and Clytie, after a few turns about the room,
      putting things more or less straight, unfolded the dirty wrapper of Jack's
      packet, with an amused curiosity as to the features of Jack's father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in another second all her curiosity, amusement, idle interest, were
      fled, and her whole emotive force concentrated into a short, irrepressible
      gasp of astonishment. It was a photograph of Thornton, her husband. There
      was no mistaking it. She had the fellow to it in her album. One day long
      ago she had seen it among his odds and ends, and had begged for it, loving
      it for all that it was so many years old, taken when he was still in the
      army. He looked so stalwart, soldierly, magnificent in his uniform. It was
      perhaps the likeness of him that she had cherished most&mdash;only too
      familiar. For a moment she could hardly understand&mdash;the shock was so
      sudden and unexpected. Then with the quick reaction she realised what it
      meant. Thornton was Jack's father, Mrs. Burmester was his mother. With a
      shudder of disgust she threw the photograph on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The riddle of Jack's parentage was solved in a way she had not looked for;
      the mystery that had lain hidden in strange, unknown depths of passion was
      now clear to her in all its unlovely nakedness. Her soul sickened at the
      truth. She had not come to her husband with the helpless ignorance of a
      young girl. The knowledge of good and evil, to employ the somewhat
      meaningless euphemism, had come to her through her intelligence by means
      of books, through her contact with real life. She had grasped the fact of
      the existence of the Loulou Mendès type with whom love is a trade. That a
      man should have had a liaison with such a woman she could have understood.
      In fact she never at any one moment had fancied that Thornton had brought
      to her the pure ardour of a virgin soul. To have been revolted at the
      discovery of a mere antenuptial infidelity on the part of her husband
      would have been to her impossible. It was not noble, it is true; but it
      was intelligible. There was certainly for a lower nature a charm,
      witchery, fascination, in the fleshly beauty of the courtesan. She had
      heard of many men falling victims to it, and sinking very little into
      degradation. If Jack's mother had been such a woman, she would have felt
      little more than the shock of coincidence, a sense of strangeness in her
      relations with the boy. But Jack's mother was not of this type. She never
      had charm, witchery, or fascination. She had never even passable good
      looks. A poor, stolid, dull, animal drudge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth had come upon Clytie; the truth that had touched her now and
      then with its bat wings, making her shiver; the horrible, soul-nauseating
      truth of the eternal <i>beast</i> in man. She knew Thornton now as he was,
      and her indifference passed into loathing. In Thornton's feelings what
      difference had there been between this boy's mother and herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked swiftly up and down the studio, with clenched white hands, her
      shoulders rising now and then in an involuntary heave of disgust. The
      glory had gone out of the day. A foul shadow overspread it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Thornton himself appeared with eager face, a telegram in his
      hand. He had just come in from riding in the Park, and according to the
      modern fashion out of the season, was dressed in tweed suit and gaiters.
      He carried a silver-headed riding whip jauntily under his arm. He waved
      the telegram exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have asked me to put up for Witherby!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll have some
      lunch on the strength of it. I suppose there's some going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe lunch is at the usual hour,&rdquo; said Clytie, not looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered a little, flicking his legs with his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well congratulate me, if only for the sake of politeness,&rdquo;
       he said in an injured tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I congratulate you,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sounded strange in her own ears. She felt an almost irresistible
      impulse to burst forth into a torrent of speech, to say out finally all
      the bitterness and loathing that were in her heart. She restrained
      herself, but the effort gave a queer guttural resonance to her words. She
      turned and looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil's the matter?&rdquo; he asked impatiently. &ldquo;I came in, 'pon my
      soul, thinking you'd be pleased. It's a safe seat. I'm dead certain to
      knock the confounded Radical into a cocked hat. Just the moment when I've
      got what I've been sweating for the last eighteen months, confound it all,
      I did think you'd be civil for once in a way. But it's just like you; I
      might have expected it. Well, perhaps it's the truth to say you don't care
      a damn one way or the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked to and fro for a little, fuming. Then his eyes falling on the
      photograph that lay on the table, he picked it up, as an angry man will
      do, looked at it absently for a moment, and pitched it sharply to the
      other side of the room. Clytie, startled by the slight click of the
      cardboard striking against the wall, turned half round and met his eyes
      fixed loweringly upon her. Each held the other spellbound for a few
      seconds. Then the door opened and Jack came into the studio, checking his
      motion forward as he saw Thornton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is this?&rdquo; cried the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swift, instinctive glance Clytie compared the two faces. They were
      astonishingly alike. The same finely moulded features, dark lucent eyes,
      brown crisp hair, white evenly set teeth; the same lines of cruelty at the
      corners of the lips. Strange that, much as she had studied Jack's
      physiognomy, the likeness had never suggested itself. At Thornton's
      petulant question the boy looked at him half frightened, and then at
      Clytie, and was about to shrink back. But she called him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go away without your drawing, Jack. This,&rdquo; she said coldly to
      Thornton, &ldquo;is a <i>protégé</i> of mine. He was once my model&mdash;for my
      picture 'Jack.' Here, Jack, take your drawing. Run home. Thank you for
      coming to see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and the photograph. You said you'd give it me back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie went to the table where she had thrown it. Not seeing it, she
      remembered the sound that had startled her, and turning round, perceived
      the photograph lying face upwards on the floor. She gave a little start of
      dismay. The situation threatened to become dramatic, and she was
      unprepared. In her hurry to dismiss the boy she had forgotten the
      photograph. Now he had called attention to it, and she felt bound to
      restore it to him to save the poor little urchin's honour and most
      probably his back. And Thornton was leaning against the mantelpiece, with
      his hands in his pockets, frowningly surveying the scene. With outward
      calm, but with a beating heart, she picked up the photograph, wrapped it
      in the dirty covering, and put it into Jack's hand. Thornton, who had
      watched her movements with gathering surprise, strode forward with an
      oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Clytie quickly interposed herself between him and the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away!&rdquo; she said in a hasty whisper, and Jack, accustomed from his
      childhood to sudden dartings, disappeared like a flash. Clytie put her
      back against the door and looked at her husband with strange eyes. It had
      been done with the speed of a conjuring trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; asked Thornton; &ldquo;and what are
      you giving away my photographs for? Upon my soul, I think you are taking
      leave of your senses. You'll have to drop this sort of thing. I'm damned
      if I am going to have my photographs given away to all the street urchins
      in London. Play the fool yourself if you like, but I'll trouble you to
      keep me and my things out of it. Have you been giving me away any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God! Thornton, you have given yourself away!&rdquo; she cried, echoing his
      slang phrase half unconsciously in her bitterness. &ldquo;I'll tell you, if you
      like. The photograph belongs to the boy's mother. He is your child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Thornton in a voice of thunder, showing his teeth savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your child,&rdquo; she went on, striving to be calm. &ldquo;His mother's name is
      Burmester. You gave her the picture yourself years ago. I had just made
      the discovery when you came in. Ah&mdash;h!&rdquo; she cried, putting her hands
      suddenly before her face, &ldquo;it is horrible, horrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; retorted Thornton fiercely. &ldquo;You are in one of your damned
      high-horse moods. Well, I did give one of my father's kitchen-maids a
      photograph, and she did have a child, and I paid her for her trouble, and,
      damme! what that's got to do with you now is more than I can see. Besides,
      you never were such a fool as to imagine you were marrying an infernal
      saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, stop! stop!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Don't say anything more. You will brutalise
      me as well as yourself. I never thought you a saint&mdash;even when I
      cared for you. I know what you are, and, oh, God! this is the end of it.
      If you had betrayed a sweet, innocent girl, you would have been a villain,
      but not necessarily a brute&mdash;someone charming, pretty, attractive&mdash;I
      could have understood it; but a poor stupid drudge&mdash;a kitchen-maid&mdash;little
      better than an animal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thornton rushed forward and caught her by her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord God! if you don't hold your tongue, I'll strike you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She saw that she had aroused the devil in him. She had meant to be calm,
      to tell him plainly the facts of the case and to say that it would be
      better that they should live apart. But an irrepressible shudder had come
      over her, and then the brutal cynicism of his confession had caused her
      the loss of her self-control. As she saw the blazing eyes and white
      glittering teeth in front of her and felt the grip on her shoulder, she
      regretted that she had been, in a way, to blame; but she was no coward,
      and the threat awakened the fierce old Puritan courage in her nature. She
      did not flinch, but looked him directly in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your striking me would only add to your other brutalities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he cried in blind fury; and swinging her round, he struck her
      with the riding whip with all his huge strength, cutting the back of the
      thin morning gown, that flew open at the gap, showing her bare shoulders.
      Then he hurled her from him and rushed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an almost superhuman effort of will Clytie sprang to her feet, stood
      for a moment dazed, stunned, on fire with agony, then staggered forward
      and threw herself upon the bearskin rug, with the illustrated History of
      England, open as Jack had left it, beneath her face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>uddenly Clytie
      rose to her feet and left the studio. As she moved a strange weight seemed
      to lie upon her limbs. It was a physical effort to drag herself up the
      stairs to her bedroom. Her heart seemed to be burned through, a fiery
      sword to have been thrust through her temples. It was the supreme moment
      of the horror and abasement of her married life. One intense thought
      possessed her; to fly from the house, to escape from the area of
      Thornton's influence, to bury herself somewhere far away. Mechanically she
      changed her things, choosing one of the simple morning dresses she had
      retained since the days before her marriage, and bathed her feverish face
      and hands. The cold water refreshed her, restored adjustment to her
      quivering nerves, and she was able to think, form a coherent plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would go forthwith to her old rooms in the King's Road, which she knew
      to be vacant. There she would live again as Clytie Davenant, and shut out
      of her memory the nightmare of the past months. The plan conceived, she
      hurried to put it into execution. She would have liked to open the street
      door there and then, to cross its threshold for the last time. But the
      practical side of life asserts itself in the midst of the intensest
      emotions. She would have to pack her boxes, select what things she would
      take with her. The aid, too, of the servants would be necessary. After a
      swift look at the glass she composed her features, summoned her maid, gave
      her orders in a calm, equable voice, as if she were going on an ordinary
      visit in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the servants packed the articles she designated, she went down to
      the studio in order to collect a few of the portable objects that were
      dear to her: Rupert Kent's etching, the Jacquemart that Kent had given
      her, a book or two, a favourite box of oil-tubes. All the rest she would
      leave behind, together with everything that Thornton had ever given her.
      The maid, an excellently trained servant, packed quickly, but to Clytie
      she seemed unutterably slow. It was an effort of control to refrain from
      urging the girl on, from snatching the articles from her hands and stowing
      them away anyhow, haphazard. Every moment that she lingered seemed an
      eternity of degradation. In after days she wondered that she had never
      reflected how far Thornton's possible presence in the house might have
      affected the ease of her escape. As it happened, he had flung out of doors
      as soon as he had left her stricken upon the floor; but she, in the fixity
      of her idea, never concerned herself as to his whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, when the boxes were packed and locked, the maid, dangling the
      keys in her hand, asked Clytie when she should order the brougham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go in a four-wheeled cab with the luggage,&rdquo; said Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and order one round at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid retired wonderingly, and Clytie was left alone. She put on her
      bonnet and sat down on the edge of the bed to draw on her gloves. Then for
      the first time her eye fell consciously upon her wedding-ring, and
      thereupon came over her the sense of all that her present action implied:
      the final renunciation of the marriage-tie, the assertion of her own
      individuality, the beginning of another life. And yet, in spite of her
      repudiation, the tie remained, indissoluble except by death, and this
      little circlet of gold was the symbol. With a twinge of pain she wrenched
      it off, for it was tightly fitting, and went and threw it in a jewel box
      containing the jewellery that Thornton had given her. At any rate, she
      could spare herself the hourly misery of this visible bond. It was a poor
      kind of relief to leave it there with the other tokens of her wifehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as she waited, her crushed pride rose a few degrees. Whatever
      subsequent steps Thornton might take, her departure should at least not
      have the indignity of flight. A scribbled line would save her
      self-respect. When the servants came into the room to take down the boxes
      to the cab she had written the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving your house. I go back to my old rooms in the King's Road,
      where I shall resume the life I led before I knew you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then only did it occur to her to inquire of the footman whether Mr.
      Hammerdyke was in. The man, who was accustomed to the separation between
      the lives of his master and mistress, replied, without manifesting any
      surprise at the question, that Mr. Hammerdyke had gone out just before
      lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put this note in his room for him,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;I shall be away some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments she had started. With a little convulsive moan, wrung
      involuntarily from her lips by her agony of body and soul, she leaned her
      head against the rusty cushions of the ramshackle vehicle and closed her
      eyes. The day was still glorious, London bathed in sunlight, the streets
      filled with life and motion. For all the world but her the promise of the
      morning was kept. As the cab slackened its pace on crossing the Fulham
      Road she opened her eyes for a moment, and looked vacantly, as if in a
      dream, out of the window. Then she relapsed into her darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I was so happy this morning,&rdquo; she murmured to herself. &ldquo;I could have
      lived the better life&mdash;with Kent's help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent! She started, as a wave of blood rushed to her cheeks. She was going
      to Kent now, to live under the same roof with him once more, to see him
      daily, to take him more intimately than ever into her life. Until now she
      had not realised this coherently. Vague thoughts of him had passed through
      her mind, but she had been too dazed, too sickened, too much possessed by
      the overpowering longing for freedom, escape from the house of bondage, to
      connect him definitely with her immediate future. And in the unconscious
      sequence of ideas a little self-reproach came into her mind, bringing with
      it a sense of soothing. Why had she not thought of Kent at first, of the
      true, loyal friend and lover, on whom she could rely for strength and
      comfort? How could she have been so much wrapped up in herself and her
      wrongs as never to have given him a place in her plans? And then the tide
      of feeling ebbed back again, leaving her heart quite cold and sad. How
      could she meet him? How could she tell him? The eternal woman in her
      shrank from the confession. If he had been to her but a friend, it had
      been easy. But she loved him. Had not her heart sung within her that very
      morning, only a few hours before, at the grace and tenderness of her at
      last awakened love? And she fought, womanlike, against she scarce knew
      what, striving to disentwine herself like Laocoon from the coils that love
      and circumstance had wound, in subtle intricacy of convolution, about her
      heart. But for all her shrinking she longed for Kent. If only he could
      understand it all without her telling! If only he could come that evening
      and sit by her side and hold her hand in strong, mute sympathy! Well, she
      would conquer her woman's diffidence, and tell him bravely. She felt she
      owed him a little reparation. The inherent delight in putting itself in
      the wrong is perhaps one of the most elusive traits of a woman's nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cab stopped before the familiar side door. Mrs. Gurkins, standing
      beneath the awning of the shop between the stalls of cabbage and fruit,
      gave a gasp of bewilderment as she saw Clytie alight from the
      luggage-laden vehicle. She ran round through the connecting passage and
      opened the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not coming to stay here, miss?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only in moments of calm reflection that she could bring herself to
      address Clytie more decorously as &ldquo;ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; replied Clytie in her decisive way. &ldquo;Can I have my old
      rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, miss&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have my boxes taken up and get things straight for me, Mrs.
      Gurkins. You know what an erratic creature I am, don't you? I think I am
      going to stay a very long time. I'll go and see Miss Marchpane while you
      do all that is necessary. You'll forgive me for putting you to all this
      trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;La, miss&mdash;ma'am, I'm that glad to have you back! But Miss Marchpane
      left early to-day&mdash;about an hour ago. You can go up to the
      sitting-room. I was cleaning it out only yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie went upstairs to the familiar room, and took off her bonnet and
      gloves. In a few moments the boxes were brought up. When she had unpacked
      these and arranged their contents, and eaten as much as she could of the
      meal that Mrs. Gurkins prepared for her, the glorious afternoon had melted
      into night. She sat by the open window and looked out upon the hurrying
      street below. It was a Saturday evening. The whole population of the
      district was astir buying their Sunday provisions or their Sunday
      headaches. Bands of the youth of both sexes clattered noisily past,
      singing hoarsely or darting from pavement to roadway in loud, dissonant
      gaiety. Along the kerb stretched the line of costers' barrows with flaming
      naphtha torches, and the faces of the sellers and buyers stood out clear
      in the glare. A babel of sounds arose: the confused murmur of private
      conversations pitched in the discordant key of the unrefined, the raucous
      cries of the costers offering their wares, the shrill &ldquo;Buy! buy!&rdquo; of the
      butcher a few yards away and the rapid click of his steel, the doleful
      nasal dirge of a tramp woman holding a vague bundle looking like a baby in
      her arms, the continuous scraping of feet, the roar of the 'buses and
      carts in the roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie had often before sat on Saturday evenings at her window, lost in
      the wonder of speculation upon the individualities of the units that
      composed this hurrying, bawling, laughing, cursing crowd. And now she felt
      the old fascination creep over her. The noise and movement acted as a
      counter-stimulus to the fierce whirl of emotions through which she had
      passed during the day. She lost for the time the sense of loneliness,
      soul-sickness, and bodily prostration in this external world of tumult.
      What did it all mean, this hurry and strain? Looked at as a whole, it
      seemed to indicate that life was intense, earnest, throbbing with infinite
      variety of passions, an end in itself, to be carried on, because it was
      life, to all eternity. It seemed real, practical, objective, obeying
      inscrutable, immutable laws. The planets circle round the sun; our solar
      system circles round another focal sphere. It is great, it is glorious,
      serving some great and glorious end; yet what that end is no man knoweth.
      And so with the collective life that surged beneath Clytie's window,
      yielding blindly to the unchanging laws that direct the cosmos. If this
      movement was meaningless and vain, then did the stars wander futilely in
      their courses. Sin and shame and misery, love and laughter and happiness,
      what did they matter in the progress of collective life? They are internal
      forces affecting its resistless march as little as the incessant motion of
      men affects the rotation of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the individuals, when detached from the conglomerate mass of humanity&mdash;what
      was this life to them? How far was it a gracious thing to yonder bawling
      cheap-jack, with his red, sodden face? And the factory girl, with her
      feathered hat and deep fringe overshadowing pinched, soulless features,
      looking hungrily at his Brummagem wares; the fat, unintelligent workman's
      wife gossiping loudly of sickness, death, and funerals; the besotted navvy
      stumbling along in the grip of a soberer friend&mdash;how far were they
      intellectually, spiritually, cognisant of life? Again as of old these
      questions presented themselves to Clytie. During these latter months she
      had been too closely confronted with the problems of her own personality
      to interest herself in that of others. But now a newly awakened
      self-knowledge had given her a key to mysteries to the elucidation of
      which she had once devoted all her artistic powers. She had arrived at the
      truth of the relativity of individual life. There was no such thing as
      absolute fulness of existence. Everyone&mdash;coster, factory girl,
      statesman, poet&mdash;was striving, each in his way, after a completer
      life, but the ideal of completeness was limited by each individual's
      capacity for action, sensation, and thought. Hence yonder factory girl's
      life might be relatively as full as her own, the hunger for the unknown
      that would complete it as loudly clamourous. Clytie was glad for the
      moment, almost happy. New artistic stirrings seemed to be at work within
      her soul. Heretofore she had sought a solution for the problems of life
      through her art. Might not this newer knowledge and more extensive
      sympathy enable her to present finely perceived truths, thus making her
      art less self-centred, more universal?
    </p>
    <p>
      This train of thought was working through her mind as she sat by the
      window, resting her cheek on her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, however, the thoughts confused themselves into a medley of dim
      associations, which in their turn became lost in drowsiness. Worn out by
      the physical strain of the day, she fell asleep in the midst of the uproar
      that arose from the hurrying street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she became conscious of a presence beside her in the room, and,
      starting up, beheld Kent looking down upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get cold or a stiff neck or something sleeping by the open window
      like that,&rdquo; he said in his kindly way. &ldquo;And yet I did not like to wake
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do feel a little cramped,&rdquo; said Clytie, rising. &ldquo;But the night is hot.
      Bring another chair and sit down. I shall not go to sleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent did as she bade him, and they sat on either side of the window,
      Clytie with face half averted looking into the street, Kent leaning
      forward, gazing at her with troubled eyes. For some moments neither spoke.
      At last Kent broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I wrong to come in? Do you want to be alone? Tell me frankly and I
      will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; stay,&rdquo; replied Clytie slowly, without turning her head. &ldquo;I wanted you
      to come. I don't know why. How did you find out I was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Gurkins caught me in the passage. She said you were staying some
      time. I knocked at your door, but you did not answer, so I looked in, saw
      you asleep there. I could not resist the temptation of coming nearer so as
      to see your face. You look so done up, you must go to bed early and have a
      good night's rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Kent! How like you!&rdquo; said Clytie, looking quickly round at him.
      Womanlike, she was pleased that he had not expressed wonderment at her
      presence in the house, and beset her with abrupt questions, but tried
      instead with delicate sympathy to put her at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you guess why I am here, Kent?&rdquo; she asked in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not try,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have finally parted from my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God! Clytie, what do you mean?&rdquo; he cried, with a leap at his heart,
      followed by a feeling of great pity for the woman he loved, an aching
      sense of the irony of things. &ldquo;It has been a misunderstanding. It will all
      be cleared up in time,&rdquo; he continued unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clytie shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; thank God, this is the end. See my hand: that which was there I drew
      off to-day for the first time. It shall never be there again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie, my dear friend Clytie!&rdquo; said Kent, very much moved. &ldquo;What can I
      say to you? My heart aches for all that you must have suffered. You told
      me yesterday your life was not what I thought it to be, for I fancied you
      happy, with all around you to make the world bright and glorious. I do not
      know what to think now. Is there no hope for your happiness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Kent, not that way. Let me tell you at once what I can. Don't
      judge me severely. I did what lay in my nature to do. I bore things that
      nearly drove me mad, although perhaps many other women would not have
      looked on them as burdens. But my marriage was a mistake&mdash;for both of
      us. And then&mdash;oh, how can I tell you? Something happened to-day, the
      climax, rendering further life there impossible. Oh, I can't speak or even
      think of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice ended in a moan and a shivering catch of her breath, and she
      covered her face with her hands. Kent leaped to his feet quivering with a
      sudden intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie, you have been wronged far more than by mere misunderstanding. Did
      he dare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. Don't think of it. It's all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must think of it. It is like a red-hot iron in my heart. I can't
      bear it. All last night I lay awake thinking of your unhappiness, tortured
      by regrets, hating the man who made your life a weariness to you. I never
      thought of this. The coward! The brute! Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he strode up and down the room, with set lips and clenched hands,
      Clytie looked at him half-wonderingly. She had never seen her calm, strong
      Kent so moved by passion. She went up to him, with natural impulse, and
      put her hand on his shoulder and looked into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need never speak or think of this again, Kent. It is all over,
      buried. For nearly a year we have lived almost as separated as we shall do
      henceforward. I have come to be Clytie Davenant once again, to lead the
      old life of work and happiness with you and Winifred. I can blot out the
      past eighteen months like an evil dream in which I have suffered much and
      learned much. We can work together as we used to do, Kent, and you will
      find me, I hope, a better, gentler woman, dear. Now forget all about it,
      as I shall do. Remember what you said yesterday&mdash;that no life was so
      wrecked as to be incapable of reconstruction. You cannot tell what comfort
      you gave me. And I cannot tell you what happiness I passed through this
      morning&mdash;before&mdash;ah, well&mdash;&mdash;Oh, Kent, my true, loyal
      Kent! I am a very weak woman, and I want your goodness and help and
      tenderness. You can do nothing to help or avenge what has passed. You can
      do all for me in the future if you will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I can do is small enough, God knows!&rdquo; replied Kent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you can do for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me forget myself and my selfish wants in trying to bring some help
      and gladness into your life. I wronged you deeply once&mdash;I wronged
      myself; let me make reparation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent turned aside and passed his hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not think of me,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;I am rough and
      strong, with no particular burdens to bear. Some day or the other, when
      you are happy, I will come to you with my little griefs for the sake of
      having them charmed away by your sympathy; but until then let me think of
      you&mdash;help you if I can. If I can't, Heaven knows it will not be for
      want of longing to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kent,&rdquo; said Clytie very softly, unconsciously moving nearer to him, &ldquo;I am
      happy now. Can't you see that I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent's heart beat like a sledge hammer; a wave of passionate love swept
      through his veins, thrilling him to the finger tips. He was conscious that
      if he turned his face the hair on her forehead would brush his cheek.
      Never before had a woman spoken to him in that strange tone. The world
      stood still for a moment. Then in a blinding daze of light, in which all
      things in heaven and earth were drowned, he turned, caught her to him, and
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Clytie freed herself, held out a restraining hand, and, with steps
      strangely faltering, moved across the room to the couch, where she sat
      down and hid her face in the cushions. Kent paused for a moment, steadying
      his senses still reeling from the shock of the first kiss of love he had
      ever given to woman. Then he went and stood by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, Clytie. It was base of me. But it was something beyond my
      will that acted. You forget that I love you. I have wronged you, my queen,
      my life! If you can ever trust me again, I will devote myself to making
      you forget that I have dared to love you. I ask your pardon, Clytie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stayed for a moment looking at her bowed figure. Then, as she gave no
      sign that she was moved by his appeal, he left her, and with a strange
      mingling of death and gladness in his heart walked lingeringly to the
      door. But just as his hand was on the knob Clytie rose impulsively from
      the couch, and with hair ruffled and her cheeks glowing came up to him,
      and it was she who opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pardoned, dear, for I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment later she was alone. And she resumed her position by the open
      window, and looked out upon the busy scene. But she heeded it not. Her
      sight was directed to the mysteries of an invisible world.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Clytie's last words rang in Kent's ears all night. She loved him. She had
      surrendered herself to his kiss, she had told him her heart in plain,
      unequivocal language. In the first blaze of this happiness he did not
      perceive the gloomy background of their love. All that he could feel was
      that Clytie had left the life to which he had been a stranger, that she
      had come back to live in his daily company in the old helpful way, that,
      furthermore, her simple friendship had changed into something unutterably
      sweeter. He looked into the future and found it glowing with many rose
      tints of beauty. He saw Clytie and himself carrying out to its fullest his
      brave gospel of work&mdash;to its fullest because of their belief and
      trust in one another. He saw Clytie painting noble pictures, drawing
      strength and confidence from his sympathy&mdash;himself stimulated to
      great achievement, the prose of life transmuted into sonorous epic,
      lyrical gladness, elegiac grace. The fever in his blood kept him awake as
      image after image passed before his fancy. But whether the vision was of
      Clytie walking by his side through the gaslit streets, or of Clytie's
      glorious head strained back to view the effect of brush strokes he had
      suggested, or of Clytie sitting by the table as he worked, the lamp
      between them, it ended always with the warm touch of Clytie's lips beneath
      his, and the low, clear voice, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exaltation is common to most men when a strong love comes to them.
      But to Kent it was all the intenser through the peculiarities of his
      nature. He had lived without the sphere of women. The passionateness of
      his temperament had thrown itself utterly into another channel. His work
      had been his love, his wife, the centre of all his energies, all his
      hopes. The craving for the unknown complement of existence had found
      satisfaction in the added line upon line, the growing bulk of manuscript,
      the builder's thrill when the creation of his own brain is materialising
      itself course by course into a majestic edifice. Besides, action, whether
      it was spending hours in a musty library in the exciting search after a
      reference, or tramping for miles in the keen mountain air of Norway,
      always fascinated him and compelled the entire energy of his being. He
      beheld the earth after his wholesome fashion and saw that it was good. To
      him life was complete. Things, therefore, not contained within his sphere
      he looked upon as superfluities. Woman was a superfluity; the impulses of
      sex repugnant. The very intensity of his nature made him shrink all the
      more strenuously from the sexual principle upon which love is built. When,
      however, love came to him, in spite of himself, he was dazed with it,
      terrified. On that January morning when he buried his face in the faint
      perfume of Clytie's handkerchief he felt himself overcome with a kind of
      horror. The fierce consciousness that he would give his soul to hold her
      in his arms and kiss her hair and eyes and lips was to him a torture of
      debasement. This morbidness was due only to the violence of the reaction.
      It lasted but a short while, and toned down into a feeling of disloyalty
      to Clytie's friendship in daring to love her. But time at last adjusted
      his moral balance, when it was too late, and Clytie was lost to him. And
      then his love was purified into a deep, passionate devotion that was its
      own joy and recompense. If circumstances had remained unchanged, Kent
      would have carried this deeper than romantic love with him to the grave.
      It had grown into his inmost heart, informing that subconsciousness that
      makes a man's individual life. Even during the last few months, when they
      were meeting in frank, friendly fashion, his love had altered very little
      in kind. He believed her to be a happy wife, loving her husband, with whom
      in a moment of bitterness he had once silently measured himself. The
      precious boon of her friendship was regained, nothing more, and it was
      given to him, under no false pretences on his part, but all the more
      tenderly because she knew of his devotion. Secure in the impression of her
      happiness, he would never have wavered in word or thought from his
      straightforward, simple loyalty, and his days would have passed in quiet
      contentment, saddened a little, perhaps, by regrets for what might have
      been, but never tormented by longings for the impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But conditions were no longer the same. Clytie had renounced her married
      life. Except as a memory of bitterness it had no place in her thoughts.
      Except by a legal fiction she was her own mistress once more, free to go
      and come, think and act. Even in name she would be Clytie Davenant again,
      and she had spoken to him in that strange tone he had never heard before,
      and had come nearer to him as her touch lay upon his arm. The whole pent
      up passion of Kent's life had gone forth into that kiss. For Kent the
      world was changed, and the night a dream of unutterable things. But by the
      morning it had brought counsel. This love, acknowledged on both sides&mdash;whither
      would it tend? A great problem. So great a one, indeed, that Kent was
      tempted to shirk grappling with it. Courage and a stout heart, he said to
      himself, and all would be well. But one cannot rid one's self in this easy
      way of responsibilities. If you shake them from your shoulders, they
      shackle themselves about your feet. Kent felt thus fettered as he lay
      awake. Moreover, his early misgivings concerning Hammerdyke came, like the
      curses in the proverb, home to roost. If he had spoken to Clytie then,
      before her marriage, possibly she might have been spared all this
      suffering. He wished that he had obtained from Wither all the particulars
      of the ugly rumours that had been afloat, investigated them, confronted
      Clytie bravely with the truth, and so saved her from wrecking her life.
      And yet he felt that he could not have done so. Well, what was past was
      past. The present and the future contained enough matter to engage his
      attention. He lay for some time in bed trying to solve these perplexities.
      At last, at half-past nine, he rose, dressed, and went into his
      sitting-room to prepare his breakfast. This was a simple process. On a
      couple of gas-stoves, connected by india-rubber piping with the two
      gas-jets in his room, he placed a kettle and a saucepan, the latter
      containing eggs. Then he spread a little cloth on a clear space of his
      dresser-table, and brought out his crockery and other breakfast requisites
      from one of the under-cupboards. A ham somewhat cut into, butter, and
      marmalade he procured from a safe in a third little room on the landing
      which he used as a combined larder and lumber-room. For years Kent had
      enjoyed the simple Bohemianism of this Sunday morning meal. He could
      linger over it easefully without the weekday glance at his watch, when
      time was short. There was the Sunday paper, a weekly review or two, the
      long, undisturbed after-breakfast pipe. It was a time when he could
      release himself with free conscience from his busy life and enjoy his
      leisure. But this morning the eggs seemed stale, the ham tasteless, the
      journals dull, and he found himself looking at his watch. He would go down
      and see Clytie at eleven, an hour which he had himself arbitrarily fixed
      upon, and he was counting the minutes. It is surprising how long minutes
      are when you count sixty of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last eleven o'clock came and Kent descended the stairs. But Clytie was
      out. Mrs. Gurkins, who answered his ring on Clytie's bell, informed him
      that Miss Davenant would not be in for lunch. Perhaps she would be back
      during the afternoon. So Kent went upstairs again, disappointed, and,
      after vainly trying to occupy himself, seized his hat and went out for a
      long tramp through Putney and Wimbledon. His heart was full of strange
      emotions that beset him for many hours, making them seem hopelessly long.
      Of the two Clytie passed by far the happier day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon, on his return, he heard voices in the studio. He knocked
      and entered. Clytie was there with Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Clytie. &ldquo;Why do you ask? We have been expecting you ever
      so long. In fact we have kept tea waiting for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put down his hat and stick, nodded as usual to Winifred, and advanced,
      through force of later habit, with outstretched hand, to Clytie. She laid
      her fingers in his slowly, looked up at him from her chair by the stove,
      and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget I am no longer a visitor, Kent,&rdquo; she said rebukingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this once, then,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to welcome you back among us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you learned to make pretty speeches?&rdquo; asked Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pleased with the words and gave his hand a sudden pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kent brought a chair up to where Clytie and Winifred were sitting, tried
      to talk lightly, and failed. A silence came over the little party. Tea
      caused a distraction, and they fell to discussing indifferent subjects,
      odds and ends of gossip, but in a desultory fashion that each found
      strange. At last Clytie rose, cut the Gordian knot in her impulsive way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to do one or two things in the sitting-room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
      two have a talk until I come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent opened the door for her. On the threshold she turned and whispered to
      him: &ldquo;Talk to Winifred a little. You will do each other good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door after her and went back to Winifred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we have her with us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied gently, &ldquo;and I don't know whether to feel sorry or
      glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know&mdash;had you any idea that she was unhappy? I never knew
      till yesterday&mdash;or the day before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I knew&mdash;before&mdash;perhaps because I am a woman. It made
      my heart ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she is not unhappy now,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;Therefore you ought to be glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred glanced at him swiftly. In spite of the brown softness of her
      eyes they were woman's eyes, capable of quick, subtle perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will she be happy, Kent?&rdquo; she asked, bending down over her
      needlework. As she had not been able to paint, she had taken in hand, by
      way of feminine comfort, some sewing for Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, with a man's preference to answer a concrete
      question rather than a delicately hinted suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will not this tie that cannot be loosed hamper her all through her life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; he said gloomily. And then, brightening, he added: &ldquo;But we
      have her with us for always, Winifred, and we who love her can try to make
      her forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, can we, my dear Kent?&rdquo; she said, putting her work and both hands in
      her lap and looking at him. &ldquo;You love her, but you can't love her as I do.
      Oh, no, no,&rdquo; she added as he smiled and shook his head. &ldquo;You may think you
      do, but it is not possible. You have found faults in Clytie and scolded
      her&mdash;oh, very kindly and sympathetically, I know, but still in your
      eyes Clytie can do wrong. In mine she can't&mdash;and there is the
      difference. Clytie is not like other girls. She is like no one in the
      world. Everything must give way to her. If Clytie were to do something you
      would think <i>dreadful</i>&mdash;commit a murder&mdash;I feel that she
      would be justified in doing it, and I should love her all the more
      tenderly and dearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless your loving little heart!&rdquo; cried Kent. &ldquo;Love like yours could
      make the most miserable creature on earth happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, no, Kent. What could I do for her? Listen: I was a poor, friendless,
      ignorant, uninteresting little girl when I first met Clytie. And she was
      kind to me. She seemed so brave and strong and clever and beautiful, I
      quite shrank from her. I felt so small and humble beside her. And she
      singled me out from among all the rest of the girls at the Slade School,
      and made me her friend. I never could tell what she found in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can tell, and I can, too,&rdquo; exclaimed Kent with abrupt enthusiasm&mdash;&ldquo;the
      purest, tenderest flower of a soul that ever breathed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kent!&rdquo; said Winifred as the colour rose to her dark cheeks. &ldquo;You must
      not say things like that. Clytie has done everything for me, everything&mdash;and
      I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have helped Clytie as no one else could have done,&rdquo; said Kent, &ldquo;and
      you are doing it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; don't you see how bright and happy you have made her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is brighter than I should have thought,&rdquo; said Winifred musingly. &ldquo;But
      will it last?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must try to make it lasting, you and I,&rdquo; said Kent softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered for a moment over the love in each of their hearts, the girl's
      and the man's. How exquisitely pure and selfless hers seemed to be! He
      could not realise it in all its beauty, but his perceptions had been
      refined enough for him to be profoundly touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have taught me something, Winifred,&rdquo; he said after a pause, during
      which she had quietly resumed her sewing. &ldquo;I am happier than I have been
      all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie returned soon afterwards. She looked curiously at the faces of her
      two friends, and then, divining, perhaps, something of what had passed
      between them, went up to Winifred and kissed her. After this they talked
      more freely&mdash;of old habits, plans for the future. The latter were
      vague, for Winifred's marriage with Treherne was fixed for the early part
      of the next year, and the studio without Winifred was unrealisable. Still
      the plans were food for much intimate gossip, which some may liken to the
      very salt of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Winifred had gone, Kent went with Clytie into the sitting-room,
      where, furnished with hammer and nails, he hung the few pictures that
      Clytie had brought with her, together with some that had been lying about
      the studio. It was a delight to him to perform this little service for
      her, and she too felt the woman's happiness of being surrendered to a
      man's helpfulness. He fetched from his own rooms a bookstand, which he
      secured against the wall, a few curios, and an armful of the dainty
      cushions, chair backs, and curtain sashes with which his sister Agatha in
      misguided zeal had years ago supplied his drawers and cupboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not as artistic as your odds and ends, you know,&rdquo; he said by way
      of apology. &ldquo;But until you can get some together they will be more
      cheerful to look at than Mrs. Gurkins's efforts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had just completed his scheme of decoration when Mrs. Gurkins came up
      to lay the cloth for Clytie's dinner. Clytie detained him as he was about
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you stay and dine with me?&rdquo; she said half timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she could not dismiss him. To do so on conventional grounds
      would be the silliest prudery. Besides, a sense of helplessness had come
      over her, and she wanted him by her side, longed for him to think and act
      for her. The touch of any incident bordering ever so slightly on the
      dramatic would at that moment have sufficed to free the spring of feminine
      reserve and loosen passionate expression of her longing for his presence.
      But the simple commonplace of the situation saved her. Kent's eyes
      brightened at the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we can have a long evening afterwards?&rdquo; he asked half pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Clytie, with an inward smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday morning Kent, as he was starting for the Museum, put his head in
      at Clytie's sitting-room door. She was at breakfast, having risen rather
      later than usual. By her side was an open letter. As Kent entered she
      pushed back her chair and looked up at him, a gleam of gladness eclipsing
      in her eyes a late expression of pain. Kent noticed the sudden change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been sad, Clytie,&rdquo; he said in his rough tenderness. &ldquo;That is not
      right. Did you not promise me last evening that you would be happy, very
      happy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I shall be,&rdquo; she answered, taking his hand in hers and turning away
      her head. &ldquo;Only there are things that cut one to the heart. You are a man;
      you can't understand a woman&mdash;no man can, no matter how he loves her.
      Look, read that&mdash;the end of the sordid story of my latter life. Oh,
      Kent, I am not worth your love! This thing has degraded me enough, and
      this last insult&mdash;&mdash;Oh, read it and see. It would be better that
      you should know of how little account I really am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent took the letter which she thrust into his hand, and, without having
      read it, tore it into tiny pieces which he scattered through the open
      window to the four winds. Then he came and put one arm around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because one man insults you, dear, it is all the more reason that I
      should love and shield you. That part of your life is dead now. You said
      yourself this letter was the end. Let it be so, Clytie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His delicacy and tenderness moved her very deeply. Womanlike, she had
      wanted him to read the paper, and yet loved him all the more for not
      having done so. The letter was her own note to Thornton, which he had
      returned with &ldquo;You can go to the devil!&rdquo; scrawled across it. The sheer
      brutality had made her lose, as it were, her self-respect, had presented
      her to her own eyes as a thing of naught, unworthy of the reverential love
      that Kent brought her. How could she honestly be to him the brightest and
      noblest of women with that scrawled thing dragging her down? Accordingly
      his actions and words gladdened her. She looked up at him, and he read as
      in some magical book the spell of tenderness that swam in her eyes. Then
      he threw himself on his knees before her and buried his face in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my love, my love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, stirred to her depths with a passionate thrill that was like a great
      pain, she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him.

      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo years passed,
      outwardly uneventful, yet momentous in the development of inner life. Her
      marriage sometimes appeared to Clytie as a far-away episode, a kind of
      dream state in which she had been invested with a strange, unrealisable
      personality. Yet influences had remained, impulses had been awakened, that
      could not again lie dormant; knowledge had come to her that could not
      lapse into oblivion, leaving no trace behind. In her daily intercourse
      with Kent her nature expanded. It lost imperceptibly that vein of hardness
      which her struggle for self-development had fostered, and the disillusions
      and repugnances of her marriage had gradually been strengthening. Except
      in a brief interval of intoxication she had never known the woman's
      sweetness of surrender. The great triumph of surrender had never even then
      been hers. And this was gradually making itself felt in her heart during
      the two years that passed from the time of leaving her husband's roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      They contained hours of sweet bitterness, it is true. Although Thornton
      had gone out of her life like an evil phantom, yet the legal tie between
      them remained unbroken. Mrs. Farquharson, who seldom did things by halves,
      after seeing her idol broken trampled it underfoot into a thousand pieces,
      and vehemently tried to persuade Clytie to seek after a divorce. She even
      insisted upon her taking counsel's opinion on the matter. But there was no
      definite evidence obtainable to support an action at law, and Clytie, sick
      at heart, was glad to dismiss the question from her mind forever. Yet in
      the eyes of the world she was Hammerdyke's wife, and so she would have to
      remain until death parted them. Perhaps when enlightenment sheds a fuller
      ray upon our civilisation we shall make radical changes in our marriage
      laws, for they are based upon the sad old fallacy that human conduct and
      human emotion are indifferently susceptible of regulation. As yet we can
      universalise only on material things: security of property, full stomachs,
      and warm backs for the poor. The facts of broken lives and torn hearts we
      can recognise only in particular instances, as they come within each man's
      individual sphere. The universality of spiritual, moral, and emotional
      suffering is as yet far from being a national conception. When this is
      attained we may hope for social conditions happier than those under which
      we struggle at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thornton had taken the most effectual steps to become an undisturbing
      element in Clytie's life. The constituency for which he had intrigued and
      striven to be nominated did not return him at the bye-election, which took
      place soon after Clytie's departure, but chose instead a radical lawyer
      with an insignificant presence and a shakiness as to aspirates. Thornton
      was disgusted and humiliated at his defeat. Politics lost their charm. An
      offer from the Belgian government to reform the administration in a wide
      tract of country whose borders were infested with Arabs came to him at
      this juncture, and found him in a mood for acceptance. He bade Mrs.
      Clavering a sardonic farewell and replunged into the wilds out of English
      ken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winifred only remained in the King's Road for a few months. Early in the
      new year she married Treherne, and Clytie was left alone. The studio
      seemed very forlorn for some time afterwards, robbed, as it were, of an
      inherent tender grace, a softening, refining influence that had always
      been dear to Clytie, even in her days of greatest wilfulness. Yet it
      gladdened her to know that Winifred was happy&mdash;married to a man of
      fine fibre who could value the exquisite gift that the high gods had given
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a lucky girl, dear,&rdquo; she said to the young bride one day when
      visiting her in her new home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; replied Winifred enthusiastically. &ldquo;A man like Victor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied Clytie drily. &ldquo;I know. He is all perfection. But the
      man doesn't live who is fit to black your boots, my child. I did not mean
      that; I meant that you were a lucky girl in having eluded your obvious
      destiny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Winifred looked at her open-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always used to think somewhat sadly about you,&rdquo; Clytie went on. &ldquo;I
      seemed to read in your face and eyes that you would marry a man quite
      unworthy of you, who would ill treat you, and that you would love him more
      as he became worse, that your life would be a dreadful, purposeless
      sacrifice. And now you see how you have escaped. Victor is just the
      husband I could have picked out for you. So you are a lucky girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were as happy as I am, darling,&rdquo; said Winifred, looking at her
      somewhat wistfully through her own gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; replied Clytie, with a flush. &ldquo;Who knows? Utter completion
      of existence is not possible in this imperfect world of ours; and if my
      life has its gaps that ache a little, yet it has its fulness, believe me,
      dear. I am happier now than I have ever been. After all, the gaps matter
      very little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are getting somewhat beyond me,&rdquo; said Winifred. &ldquo;I can't quite
      follow you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you needn't, Winnie dear,&rdquo; replied Clytie. &ldquo;Only go on loving and
      trusting me. Don't you see that I am happy because I too have a good man's
      love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if&mdash;if you had been&mdash;if things were different&mdash;you
      might have married,&rdquo; said Winifred hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not make the love less beautiful and life-giving,&rdquo; replied
      Clytie.
    </p>
    <p>
      This and other conversations of a like tenor succeeded finally in allaying
      Winifred's doubts as to Clytie's happiness. An uneasy burden was lifted
      off her mind, glad as her heart was in the new joy of her marriage.
      Henceforth she was content to take Clytie's assurances, and to trust in
      her own rooted idea that Clytie's deep, complex nature was beyond the
      reach of her simple comprehension, and ungovernable by the canons that
      regulated commoner clay. Strong in this faith, she triumphed in the first
      little conflict of opinion that arose between herself and her husband.
      Fine and generous as his views were, he had, nevertheless, a strict
      churchman's regard for the proprieties of life. The recognised intimacy
      between Clytie and Kent, harmless as it appeared before Clytie's marriage,
      had begun to cause him certain uneasiness. He was fond of them both,
      partly for their own sakes, partly on account of his wife. An unkind
      thought concerning them hurt his sensitive nature, and yet, as time went
      on, such thoughts began painfully to formulate themselves in his mind. At
      last his conscience forced him to broach the subject to Winifred. She
      listened with a little flush of spirit in her cheek, and then broke into
      such a warm torrent of words that Treherne was fairly amazed. He had never
      dreamed that his gentle, brown-eyed wife could be capable of such
      passionateness. Her logic of devotion overmastered his scruples, and he
      was almost converted to Winifred's unswerving faith. At any rate, from
      that time forth he was Clytie's firm friend and ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these two years Clytie was in some need of friends. The society in
      which she had moved during her married life was a world unknown to her
      now. Only the circle of her girlhood's acquaintances remained, and of
      these some manifested disapprobation at the mode of life she had adopted.
      Every staunch adherent was therefore of inestimable value, and half
      unconsciously she clung to every hand held out in friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resumption of her life with Kent had produced also great tension in
      her relations with Durdleham. Finally it snapped them entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't for a moment suppose,&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Blather in the last letter that
      passed between them, &ldquo;that everything is not most innocent and honourable
      on both sides. But your conduct is grossly imprudent and must inevitably
      give rise to most painful scandal. It is your duty both to the name you
      bear (painful though the associations connected with it may be) and to
      that which you had from papa to put yourself beyond the reach of calumny
      by living no longer beneath the same roof as Mr. Kent. Until you do so
      papa and Janet and myself will consider that any regard you may have had
      either for ourselves personally or for our honour as a family has entirely
      gone, and, I grieve to say it, our doors, though not our hearts, will have
      to be closed against you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie read her condemnation very sadly. She could not blame her sister.
      Mrs. Blather was acting conscientiously, according to the faith and
      tradition she had inherited from her Godfearing ancestors. Petty and
      futile as many of the formulas were by which she had been trained to
      regulate human conduct, yet there were great ones which could not do
      otherwise than command respect. &ldquo;Thou shalt not sin,&rdquo; is a formula the
      obeying or renouncing of which is often a secret for one or two human
      hearts alone. Its corollary, &ldquo;Thou shalt not appear to be sinning,&rdquo; is one
      which must be dealt with openly, under the world's eye. Mrs. Blather's
      judgment was based on this latter formula, her position unassailable. She
      had no Winifred to shake with the eloquence of love her faith in the
      formula's eternal verity. She was supported by the firm convictions of a
      lifetime, and by the unhesitating assent of her father and sister. The
      letter cut off all Clytie's hopes of ever being understood by her family.
      She herself knew their inmost hearts, was conversant with every principle
      by which they were guided, and she could bear them no ill will. But to
      them she knew she would be forever inscrutable, and she accepted their
      judgments with sad resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In point of common fact, she was called upon to make the old, old choice
      that has been offered to woman in all ages, between her family and the man
      she loved. Without a moment's hesitation she chose the man, and severed
      herself finally from her kin. Kent had become the object of her life. She
      had loved him&mdash;she knew that now&mdash;before her marriage. She had
      wronged him, as it seemed to her, by not having realised it, had received
      notwithstanding a tender, absolute devotion whose brave selflessness had
      been a revelation to her. No sacrifice that she could make for his
      happiness was too great for her. She loved him with the whole strength of
      her full nature. If any sacrifices on her part were not made, it was Kent
      that forbade them. The less he would accept the more did she find in her
      heart to offer. That she should remain in what they had begun to look upon
      as their common home seemed to be a vital necessity to his happiness. The
      mild, affectionate approval of Grace and Janet could not compensate the
      great loss that each would sustain in a rupture of their intercourse. Any
      appeal to her sister she knew would be useless. She was firm in the path
      in which she had elected to walk, and Mrs. Blather's letter remained
      unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Kent could not take this comprehensive view of humanity. That Clytie
      should be cast off by her family aroused his indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never loved you,&rdquo; he said one day. &ldquo;You were always a thorn in their
      flesh, and now they have seized an opportunity of plucking you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong, dear,&rdquo; replied Clytie. &ldquo;They loved me in their unemotional
      fashion, and if I were to die they would shed many tears and wear mourning
      for a whole year. But don't you see that I am of Samaria? I cannot pray in
      the temple of Jerusalem, and the houses of Israel are closed against me.
      It is of their religion to do so. They believe that the 'bread of the
      Samaritan is as the flesh of swine.' We cannot change their faith. We can
      only seek in Samaria for freer conditions of life, and the love of those
      who are Samaritans at heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I loved you less, I might take up as lofty a position as you,&rdquo; said
      Kent. &ldquo;But I cannot bear that even a Pharisee of the Pharisees should
      presume to judge you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have been judging me rightly or wrongly all my life,&rdquo; said Clytie,
      with a smile. &ldquo;It was my own challenge; I gave it vehemently and
      passionately as a girl when life lay before me like a closed book which
      they refused to open for me. Now that I have learned some of its secrets I
      give the challenge with a calm conviction that I am acting in accordance
      with laws higher than theirs. So do not fret about me, dear.&rdquo; And then she
      added in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I would give up all I could have in the world for you, if you
      would accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Kent put his arms around her and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept far too much in my selfishness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My old lonely life
      was happy, but it could not be so again. So in spite of all, Clytie, I
      say, Stay with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should stay whatever you said,&rdquo; returned Clytie. &ldquo;Don't fancy that all
      the giving is on my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One sad event marked the mid-time in these two years, robbing Clytie of an
      external interest that had grown to be very dear to her. The boy Jack
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first meeting with him after the terrible scene in her husband's house
      was in the studio, whither he had betaken himself on one of his frequent
      visits to Winifred. A sensation of pain caught at Clytie's heart as she
      marked the lines of Thornton's features wrought in miniature on the boy's
      face. It only lasted a few moments, and then it melted away into a great
      pity. Jack was Jack, were Thornton twenty times his father. That he was so
      parented should make her pity for him all the greater. She never felt more
      drawn towards the boy than in that first interview. She told no one but
      Kent of the secret of his parentage, not even Winifred, to whom Jack, in
      spite of full intentions, never had an opportunity of showing the
      photograph. For Mrs. Bur-mester having discovered that Jack had
      temporarily abstracted it, had cuffed him soundly and secreted the coveted
      treasure in a secure hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever hopes Clytie might have entertained as to Jack's future were cut
      short by the change in her circumstances. All she could do was to
      contribute towards his training in the sphere in which the high gods,
      assisted by Kent and Treherne had placed him. Besides, he had manifested
      no particular intellectual bent. His gifts were rather those of action;
      books wearied him, except such as dealt with wild exploit and adventure.
      And she shrank now from the idea of his entering the army&mdash;a feminine
      distaste, easily understandable. So she had perforce to concur in the
      scheme whereby he should remain another year at the school and then be
      apprenticed to a respectable trade. Kent comforted her with his
      assurances. If the boy had the fire of success in him, he would rise out
      of the common ranks. Life was all before him with its endless fortuities.
      With devoted friends watching and guiding him, it would be a poor world if
      he did not arrive at ultimate good. And Clytie in her turn comforted the
      boy, trying to soften and mould his nature with her womanly influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his last term at the school. He had won for himself the golden
      opinions of the authorities. The semi-animal little arab of four years ago
      had developed into a bright, self-reliant lad of generous impulses,
      subject, it is true, to fits of ungovernable passion, but quick to
      forgive, repent, and do penance. Suddenly Clytie received a telegram that
      Jack was very ill. She left her work and started immediately for the
      school. There she found that diphtheria had broken out among the boys, and
      Jack's was the most critical case. Day and night she nursed him. But it
      was of no avail. The boy died, and Clytie returned to London with a
      cheerless sense of loss. Mrs. Burmester, who came to see her after the
      funeral, whimpered a little, and hoped that Clytie would recommend her to
      any of her friends who happened to be in need of a charwoman. And then
      Clytie looked at the mother, thought of the father. After all, if the laws
      of heredity had anything to do with the controlling of human destinies,
      were it not better for Jack to be dead? When the woman had gone she went
      and stood before the replica of her famous picture which she had painted
      for Kent, and shook her head sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have painted there,&rdquo; she said to Kent, &ldquo;the cruelty and animalism
      that seemed to have gone out of his face latterly, would always have
      remained. Human nature is a palimpsest, dear. What is written is written
      forever, though it seem obliterated, and may be called up to the surface
      at any moment. I call Jack happy, being dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the exception of this episode the weeks and months passed in peaceful
      uneventfulness. Clytie worked assiduously at her art. At first the studio
      seemed lonely and dispiriting without Winifred. But other influences
      compensated her loss. As soon as it became known that she had resumed her
      profession, orders came in plentifully and kept her busy. And then perhaps
      Winifred's absence brought her nearer to Kent. If she worked hard all day
      and failed to reach her artistic ideal, it was deep comfort to know that
      Kent's whole-hearted encouragement would soon come and cheer her and save
      her from depression. They had learned to depend much upon each other in
      their work. In every mood they were constant companions, never weary of
      each other. Instead of walking home from the Museum, as he had done for
      years, Kent would hurry back by train from Charing Cross to Sloane Square,
      so as to shorten her loneliness by half an hour. A cup of tea, a talk over
      the day's work, perhaps a stroll along the Embankment, dinner, and then
      the long quiet evening as in the old days&mdash;such was the ordinary
      routine. Certain changes had naturally occurred in Kent's habits&mdash;changes
      for his distinct good, as Clytie used to declare laughingly. He rarely
      used the attic sitting-room. His scratch Bohemian meals were things of the
      past. What law of God or man forbade them to eat together? Clytie asked
      once in the early days when they were talking of household trifles. And
      then Kent bluntly insisted upon an arrangement whereby they divided
      equally the rent of the rooms they inhabited. It was not fair, he
      maintained, that he should give her sitting-room all that wear and tear
      without helping to pay for it. Clytie yielded, not unpleasurably, seeing
      that he was bent upon it, but she reserved the studio as her own especial
      sanctum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charm of the life grew daily upon Kent, with its infinite grace of
      little things. He told her this often, with awkward sincerity, as a man
      can only tell the woman he loves deeply. And Clytie would laugh
      contentedly and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll soon get tired of these organised meals and long for your
      freedom again. Don't you ever crave to be swallowing your coffee as you
      brush your hair in the mornings? And doesn't it chafe you all the
      afternoon at the Museum to think that there is a regular dinner awaiting
      you when you get back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; somehow I like it,&rdquo; he would reply, laughing. &ldquo;I believe I am
      developing into respectability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Combining their resources they were able to entertain in a modest way
      those of their friends who perfectly understood their relations&mdash;the
      Farquharsons, the Trehernes, Wither. On these occasions Mrs. Gurkins's
      husband, a lean, self-effacive man, would wait at table in the severest of
      black and lend immense dignity to the meal. Wither was a constant visitor.
      The &ldquo;monastery&rdquo; was broken up; Fairfax had taken a practice in a large
      country town, Green had taken a wife. Wither complained bitterly, railing
      at them both for their disgusting selfishness. Clytie learned to love the
      bright-eyed, gnomelike little being, his cynical, paradoxical talk, his
      large-heartedness which he was ever anxious to conceal from the world.
      Often when life seemed to weigh a little heavy, the future to loom
      somewhat sad, and Kent and Clytie had been sitting alone, a spell of
      wistful silence over them, Wither would come in unexpectedly, and, with
      his subtle feminine perception piercing to the heart of their mood, would
      exert himself to extra brilliancy and dissipate their cloud in laughter. A
      man by no means requires delicate tact to win a woman's love, but no man
      who displays it towards a woman can fail of winning a little of the
      overflow of her heart. Clytie was grateful to Wither. Once, when bidding
      him good-night,&mdash;Kent had gone into the passage,&mdash;she added
      impulsively, &ldquo;and thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her in his odd way, with a smile playing around his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? For being miserable and lonely and making use of you to cure
      myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they understood one another, and he was touched by Clytie's little
      tribute. And Clytie had spoken out of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, in spite of the helpfulness and comfort of their life together, there
      were gaps in its plenitude which, as she had said to Winifred, ached a
      little at times. Kent was tenderness, manly sympathy itself: he would have
      cut his tongue out rather than formulate a longing that could not be
      satisfied. But moments came when the irony of life seemed somewhat
      bitterly mocking, and caused a veil of sadness to be drawn between them.
      And like people who love deeply each was sensitive to the variations in
      the other's mood. Then Clytie would yearn for the impossible: to fix
      forever the light she loved to see in his eyes, to cling to his arm and be
      acknowledged his wife before all the world. Thus through the midst of
      their happy, earnest life ran a vein of sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the years that had passed, with their manifold emotions, experiences,
      and disillusions, with their awakenings of passion, with their plentiful
      gift of tears, with their later gift of an almost holy communion of souls,
      had completed the woman and the artist. One hunger remained to her&mdash;one
      that had had no place in her girlish cravings&mdash;a woman's hunger that
      is as a thing sacred, and wondrously softens her nature. An infinite
      compassion took within her the place of scorn. Her eyes had learned the
      trick of tenderness which illuminated her bright, fearless face. Her
      judgments became less harsh, gained in breadth what they lost in
      brilliance. She &ldquo;saw life steadily and saw it whole.&rdquo; Many of its
      mysteries had been revealed to her, and she had learned the road to the
      heart of others. The great lesson that Kent in the years before had
      suggested to her she grasped in its entirety, and it revolutionised her
      artistic career. No longer was her art a stepping-stone, a magic-lantern
      sheet on which to project life in order to realise its meaning. It was no
      longer the objective form of a vague craving, but the idealised record of
      an experience. When she painted the wistful, old-world look in a waif's
      eyes it was no longer with the impatient, fretful hope that its
      significance would be taught her from her own canvas; her awakened sight
      gazed with the sorrow of knowledge into the young soul, and she used her
      art to bear witness to the world of what was there. In a dim way she was
      conscious of this change of attitude&mdash;seeking within herself for the
      reason of the deeper, intenser, calmer feeling with which she approached
      her work. There came, too, a sense of responsibility, the necessity of
      perfecting whatever she painted in its presentation of truth. As her
      genius expanded the inner interpretation of the formula, &ldquo;Art for art's
      sake,&rdquo; dawned upon her in the realisation of the &ldquo;sorrowful great gift&rdquo;
       whereby the artist has the privilege of piercing through the media of
      sense and intellect and touching the naked soul of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went, as of old, into the streets for her models, choosing the side of
      life least understanded of Philistia, sublimating that which was
      spiritual, eternal in abject and outcast, beggar and courtesan. Strange
      were the walks of Kent and herself about the great city, by day and by
      night, and strange the spars and fragments of humanity they picked up in
      these rambles, who found their way afterwards to Clytie's studio. They
      went together to East End music halls, bank holiday gatherings, thieves'
      kitchens, night clubs in the West End, where ladies are admitted free on a
      member's introduction, Kent paying his subscription almost at the door. It
      was towards women that Clytie's sympathy flowed the strongest. Her first
      contact with one of <i>ces autres</i> in the hotel at Dinan had set a
      chord vibrating within her that now rang out full and true. She could
      paint these women, young, withered, children on the lurid threshold, old
      women with charred and blackened past. It is the moralist's part to
      condemn, evolve the moral; the artist on the higher plane disintegrates
      the spiritual from the animal and presents it in the form of Truth. From
      the comedy of misery, the tragedy of sex, the never ending drama of vice
      and crime, the one draws groans, the other tears. Each has his place in
      the cosmos. Thus Clytie, artist and woman, walked through the abomination
      of desolation and opened the eyes of the world to the glimmering spiritual
      rays that shot across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more she took out the studies she had made for the &ldquo;Faustina&rdquo;
       picture. This time she could look on them without a shudder, only sadly.
      The picture would never be painted. She was no longer in feverish,
      passionate search after mysteries that had baffled her. The picture now
      had no artistic reason for existence. It would be a cruel, despairing
      work, a tragedy of cynicism. Knowledge of the world had given her
      knowledge of self; she knew now how blent were the foreshadowings of
      passion in her own soul with those that she had hungered to express on the
      young face of Faustina. In those days she could have found a model in her
      own mirror, and then the personal note dominating the picture would have
      saved it from heartlessness. For the complete woman to paint it would be
      the presentation of the damnation of a young soul. But the contemplation
      of her earlier work suggested vividly the converse of the subject&mdash;a
      Faustina swept away by the whirl of passion with the after-light of
      innocence in her soul's depths. The conception grew within her, took form,
      awoke the full artist in the ripe woman. With a throbbing sense of
      mastery, a quivering thrill of inspiration, new to her as the first love
      kiss on a young girl's lips, she betook herself to her task.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the 5th of August, two years after Clytie had resumed her artistic
      life with Kent. The afternoon was hot and oppressive. Clytie was tired and
      lay back on the couch by the window, for she had worked unceasingly all
      through the summer and the strain was beginning to tell on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had just returned from the West End Gallery, where Clytie's picture
      had been exhibited during the season. This was the closing day, and they
      had gone to see the picture for the last time. A wealthy American had
      purchased it for the art museum of his native city, and to-morrow it would
      be packed up and sent over seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's like parting forever from the child that is dearest to you,&rdquo; she
      said with a little touch of melancholy. &ldquo;That is the worst of painting. A
      poet or a musician&mdash;even an etcher can keep his work by him, but a
      painter loses all. Doesn't it seem hard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kent acquiesced, comforted her, spoke with vague cheeriness of the law of
      sacrifice which we must all obey. On the other hand, she must think of all
      that the picture had brought her, the public fame, the homage of those
      whose opinion was dear to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; in all that I have succeeded beyond my wildest hopes,&rdquo; said Clytie.
      &ldquo;But what is it? At the Redgraves' the other afternoon crowds of people
      stared at me, whispered each other requests to be introduced to Clytie
      Davenant. The men praised all the wrong points in my picture, and the
      women tried to get at the way I did my hair. I know it's flattering to
      one's vanity, dear, and I like it. I honestly like it. But it is a
      superficial little gratification. Now it is all over I begin to think of
      what that picture has cost, what has gone to the making of it. Neither
      money nor fame can pay me back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has cost you hours of work in which you have found happiness,&rdquo; said
      Kent. &ldquo;You must not overlook that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kent!&rdquo; cried Clytie, not seeing for the moment that he had
      deliberately avoided the deeper elements in her thought. &ldquo;Don't you know
      what I mean? You who have been just now preaching to me the law of
      sacrifice! Don't you know that to be the woman to paint that picture there
      were sacrificed the traditions and formulas of my home&mdash;there were
      sacrificed the first pure flush of a girl's love, the illusions of a wife,
      the joy of motherhood, the dignity of a proud woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised herself impulsively on her elbow and continued with flashing
      eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see that? And you of all men who have shared with such
      bitterness in the sacrifice! Yes, you, my dearest, my best, my love! Your
      life has been sacrificed, your love, your devotion, your nobleness. For
      once in the world the man has paid, and not the woman. For two long years
      we have lived together, eating at the same table, living a common life,
      which, had one great fact been non-existent would have crowned our days
      with happiness. I am of Samaria&mdash;I don't care. I have offered to you
      to defy the world, to live openly together, to bear your name. You have
      said 'No,' for my sake sacrificing yourself. Can this life last forever?
      Have not the past two years been filled with longings, restraints,
      bitternesses, regrets, all silently working&mdash;you too loyal to utter
      them, I dreading lest the utterance of them on my part should render you
      unhappier?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been happy,&rdquo; said Kent. &ldquo;A thousandth part of what you have given
      me would have made me more than happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your due is a thousand times more!&rdquo; cried Clytie. &ldquo;I have given you
      little enough, but I have drawn from you the breath by which I live, the
      strength, the passion, the will by which I have reached my poor success.
      It can't be so any longer; it would be unjust, cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, my darling!&rdquo; exclaimed Kent, greatly agitated. I am a man, and you
      are saying things a man cannot bear from the woman he loves. Let us finish
      this before it is too late, and I lose mastery over myself. I have thought
      over it all&mdash;with the fiercest hunger in my heart&mdash;even in
      moments of our love that have been worth a century of misery. I have
      thought over it all ways. What was impossible two years ago is impossible
      now. I will not wreck your life by condemning you to scorn and ostracism
      and the loss of all that the outside world can give you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie did not reply, but turned her face towards the open window, looking
      with knitted brow into the patch of blue heaven that was just visible over
      the tops of the opposite houses. A great, great longing possessed her, an
      infinite tenderness towards the man who could speak and act so selflessly.
      She longed to be able to say three little words, summing up the yearning
      of her heart: &ldquo;For my sake.&rdquo; But they seemed unutterable at that hour.
      Perhaps at another time, in a moment of less vehement tone, when he was
      unawares, the words could be whispered in his ear. She sank deep into the
      thought&mdash;utter woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long, long silence, which Kent, uncomprehensive, like a man, did not
      dare to break. A thought had seized him too, a troubling doubt. Would he
      always be as strong?
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he drew mechanically out of his pocket an evening paper that he
      had bought on the way home, and as mechanically opened it and began to
      skim the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he leaped to his feet with a loud cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clytie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up, startled, and saw him standing with white cheeks and
      shaking hand, holding out the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;read!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clytie took the paper from him, and her eyes instinctively fell upon the
      paragraph:
    </p>
    <p>
      A telegram from Loango announces the death of Mr. Thornton Hammerdyke, the
      well-known explorer, in a skirmish with some Arab slave-traders. Later
      particulars will be given in our next edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper fell from her hand, and they remained for some moments
      facing each other, trembling. Then she lowered her eyes and went to him
      humbly.
    </p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
